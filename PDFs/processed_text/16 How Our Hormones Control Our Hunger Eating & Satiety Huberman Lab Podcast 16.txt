it, like, right, go, keto bar. not big fan bars general,
don't taste good me. tasted Munk Pack bars, absolutely
awesome. come lot different flavors. partial caramel sea salt one,
also sea salt dark chocolate, peanut butter dark chocolate.
bunch flavors. incredible, tried all. keep

talking hormones. Hormones incredible control many
processes brain body. Last episode, talked role estrogen
testosterone. Today going talk hormones impact feeding hunger,
well satiety, feeling don't want eat eaten enough.
Now, important understand hormones don't work alone context. Today
going describe hormones powerful effects whether not
want eat less stop eating altogether. don't own,
cooperation nervous system. today, say much
perhaps even episodes, going hear lot biology
multiple going call entry points tools can apply order
regulate levels hunger, meal timing, levels satiety not wanting
eat more. many actionable behaviors, course, also
going talk supplements actually going talk little bit brain
machine interface devices can actually involved manipulating incredible
things think hunger appetite satiety.

00:06:59 Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control

So, first thing need know nervous system side, neural
control, over-feeding hunger, area brain called
hypothalamus. forebrain, tells front brain,
base forebrain. Now, hypothalamus contains lots different kinds
neurons lots different kinds things. neurons hypothalamus
controlling sexual behavior, controlling body temperature, controlling circadian rhythms,
desire sleep awake. Even neurons controlling rage. actually
neurons stimulate send anyone rage.
just powerful control centers brain body. particular area
hypothalamus called ventromedial hypothalamus. one researchers
interested long time now, terms relationship hunger feeding.
reason is, creates paradoxical effects. mean that?
found sometimes lesioning, disrupting neurons ventromedial
hypothalamus make animals people hyperphasia, want eat crazy.


lesions individuals animals make anorexic,
make not want eat all. make food aversive. means
ventromedial hypothalamus definitely interesting control station hunger
feeding satiety, doesn't really tell going deeper level. fact,
little bit confusing paradoxical. turns multiple populations
neurons there, going talk those.

00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger

promoting feeding, promoting not feeding not eating. Now,
neural component need know about, actually
mouth. area cortex, little bit
brain, called insular cortex. processes lot different kinds information.
Mostly information going inside you, called interoception.
insular cortex neurons get input mouth, touch receptors
mouth. insular cortex powerful control whether not enjoying
eating, whether not want avoid eating, whether not
enough, whether not want continue eating more. do,
believe not, touch sensation eating. familiar this. one
people, love eating much, just like mere act chewing.
know, like celery sticks enough. not crazy them, know taste fine
like chewing celery sticks, actually just like chewing them.
eat day long except not healthy that. mere act chewing
pleasurable. People chew gum feel way well. just point
gum chewing, choose something like celery cucumber slices chew
gum, provided doesn't sugar caloric content, not going drive
increased hunger. generally isn't case. eat something sugar,
find out, specific action insular cortex areas
nervous system promotes desire eat more. key point right now
know got two brain areas, ventromedial hypothalamus, involved
hunger lack hunger, sort accelerator brake feeding.
insular cortex gets input mouth, cares chewing
consistency foods sorts interesting things just tactile.
think people think touch receptors on, excuse me, taste receptors


tongue. often don't think touch tactile essence food.
thing comes mind just now gone sushi several times, people
really like urchin. don't like urchin. something kind
creeps consistency, people love it. highly individual
probably learned, probably cultural background
raised eating urchin. people love consistency touch. touch lot
whether not want eat not. Now, get back ventromedial
hypothalamus. Sometimes makes animals people want eat more, sometimes
less, going there?

00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal Importance Hormones Hunger

classic experiment done researchers took two rats, so-
called parabiosed other. meant little surgery
linked blood supply forever physically linked one
another exchange factors blood, brains separate,
mouths separate, essentially everything separately except
linked one another. walk together go places
order it. parabiosis experiment revealed something really important.
lesioned ventromedial hypothalamus one rats connected
rat, rat got very, fat, just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
one however, got thin, actually lost weight, despite consuming
amount food prior one getting lesion.
tell us? tells us something blood exchanged
two animals, blood supply linked.
tells us hormone endocrine signals involved desire eat,
hunger appetite. next, going talk endocrine
signals are, going immediately point entry points can
use. can use even not parabiosed anything. can
allow time meal frequency, predict going hungry
not. well drive appetite. Believe not, people
trying eat more. Although think far many people trying eat less
nowadays, data just point fact essentially epidemic diabetes,
type II diabetes obesity. everyone agrees now, maintaining healthy


body weight body weight composition, one best paths longevity
just feeling good actually able think. Cognitive functioning actually
linked levels adipose tissue forth. So, talk endocrine factors

00:13:08 Neurons Powerfully Control Hunger Releasing Specific Hormones

regulate feeding, hunger satiety. One really exciting things emerge
science feeding appetite last 20 years, discovery another brain
area. not just ventromedial hypothalamus, area brain called
arcuate nucleus. arcuate nucleus really fascinating sets neurons
release even incredible molecules chemicals blood.
chemicals act accelerators feeding appetite, breaks. really cool
thing can actually control molecules simple behaviors.
understand molecules are, start understand
case. control points right now order control appetite
either direction, increase decrease. So, first all, set neurons
arcuate nucleus called PMOC neurons, okay? don't want get
acronym stands for, anyway. Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin. heard melano,
tell something pigmentation skin cells hair cells,
pigmentation sort, melanin. Last episode, talked little bit
relationship light dopamine melanin. already thinking,
wait, melano means probably something system, indeed
does. Now, POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. don't want
remember acronyms terms talked about, episode far,
try remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces
appetite powerful molecule, right? just put shelf, MSH
reduces appetite. Now, another population neurons arcuate nucleus,
called AgRP neurons. truly not going read stands
'cause related mouse strain first identified in, humans
cells well, AgRP neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate eating. anytime
approaching food, feel excitement food anxiety,
people actually experience kind heightened anxiety. people actually get little


bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin
secreted gut. activates neurons brain various locations including
PMOC neurons, neurons wingin' it. also activates VMH
particular ways. might even activate neurons
periphery mouth actually make salivate want eat, right? Now,
know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate
desire eat acting level brain. indeed point, just
mental. hear just mental, just physical, really kind thing
'cause chemicals, brain body. stimulation neurons anticipate
feeding. stimulating arcuate nucleus neurons make want eat
AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours

things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.

factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk

potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical

understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give

talking hormones. Hormones incredible control many
processes brain body. Last episode, talked role estrogen
testosterone. Today going talk hormones impact feeding hunger,
well satiety, feeling don't want eat eaten enough.
Now, important understand hormones don't work alone context. Today
going describe hormones powerful effects whether not
want eat less stop eating altogether. don't own,
cooperation nervous system. today, say much
perhaps even episodes, going hear lot biology
multiple going call entry points tools can apply order
regulate levels hunger, meal timing, levels satiety not wanting
eat more. many actionable behaviors, course, also
going talk supplements actually going talk little bit brain
machine interface devices can actually involved manipulating incredible
things think hunger appetite satiety.

00:06:59 Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control

So, first thing need know nervous system side, neural
control, over-feeding hunger, area brain called
hypothalamus. forebrain, tells front brain,
base forebrain. Now, hypothalamus contains lots different kinds
neurons lots different kinds things. neurons hypothalamus
controlling sexual behavior, controlling body temperature, controlling circadian rhythms,
desire sleep awake. Even neurons controlling rage. actually
neurons stimulate send anyone rage.
just powerful control centers brain body. particular area
hypothalamus called ventromedial hypothalamus. one researchers
interested long time now, terms relationship hunger feeding.
reason is, creates paradoxical effects. mean that?
found sometimes lesioning, disrupting neurons ventromedial
hypothalamus make animals people hyperphasia, want eat crazy.


lesions individuals animals make anorexic,
make not want eat all. make food aversive. means
ventromedial hypothalamus definitely interesting control station hunger
feeding satiety, doesn't really tell going deeper level. fact,
little bit confusing paradoxical. turns multiple populations
neurons there, going talk those.

00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger

promoting feeding, promoting not feeding not eating. Now,
neural component need know about, actually
mouth. area cortex, little bit
brain, called insular cortex. processes lot different kinds information.
Mostly information going inside you, called interoception.
insular cortex neurons get input mouth, touch receptors
mouth. insular cortex powerful control whether not enjoying
eating, whether not want avoid eating, whether not
enough, whether not want continue eating more. do,
believe not, touch sensation eating. familiar this. one
people, love eating much, just like mere act chewing.
know, like celery sticks enough. not crazy them, know taste fine
like chewing celery sticks, actually just like chewing them.
eat day long except not healthy that. mere act chewing
pleasurable. People chew gum feel way well. just point
gum chewing, choose something like celery cucumber slices chew
gum, provided doesn't sugar caloric content, not going drive
increased hunger. generally isn't case. eat something sugar,
find out, specific action insular cortex areas
nervous system promotes desire eat more. key point right now
know got two brain areas, ventromedial hypothalamus, involved
hunger lack hunger, sort accelerator brake feeding.
insular cortex gets input mouth, cares chewing
consistency foods sorts interesting things just tactile.
think people think touch receptors on, excuse me, taste receptors


tongue. often don't think touch tactile essence food.
thing comes mind just now gone sushi several times, people
really like urchin. don't like urchin. something kind
creeps consistency, people love it. highly individual
probably learned, probably cultural background
raised eating urchin. people love consistency touch. touch lot
whether not want eat not. Now, get back ventromedial
hypothalamus. Sometimes makes animals people want eat more, sometimes
less, going there?

00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal Importance Hormones Hunger

classic experiment done researchers took two rats, so-
called parabiosed other. meant little surgery
linked blood supply forever physically linked one
another exchange factors blood, brains separate,
mouths separate, essentially everything separately except
linked one another. walk together go places
order it. parabiosis experiment revealed something really important.
lesioned ventromedial hypothalamus one rats connected
rat, rat got very, fat, just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
one however, got thin, actually lost weight, despite consuming
amount food prior one getting lesion.
tell us? tells us something blood exchanged
two animals, blood supply linked.
tells us hormone endocrine signals involved desire eat,
hunger appetite. next, going talk endocrine
signals are, going immediately point entry points can
use. can use even not parabiosed anything. can
allow time meal frequency, predict going hungry
not. well drive appetite. Believe not, people
trying eat more. Although think far many people trying eat less
nowadays, data just point fact essentially epidemic diabetes,
type II diabetes obesity. everyone agrees now, maintaining healthy


body weight body weight composition, one best paths longevity
just feeling good actually able think. Cognitive functioning actually
linked levels adipose tissue forth. So, talk endocrine factors

00:13:08 Neurons Powerfully Control Hunger Releasing Specific Hormones

regulate feeding, hunger satiety. One really exciting things emerge
science feeding appetite last 20 years, discovery another brain
area. not just ventromedial hypothalamus, area brain called
arcuate nucleus. arcuate nucleus really fascinating sets neurons
release even incredible molecules chemicals blood.
chemicals act accelerators feeding appetite, breaks. really cool
thing can actually control molecules simple behaviors.
understand molecules are, start understand
case. control points right now order control appetite
either direction, increase decrease. So, first all, set neurons
arcuate nucleus called PMOC neurons, okay? don't want get
acronym stands for, anyway. Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin. heard melano,
tell something pigmentation skin cells hair cells,
pigmentation sort, melanin. Last episode, talked little bit
relationship light dopamine melanin. already thinking,
wait, melano means probably something system, indeed
does. Now, POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. don't want
remember acronyms terms talked about, episode far,
try remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces
appetite powerful molecule, right? just put shelf, MSH
reduces appetite. Now, another population neurons arcuate nucleus,
called AgRP neurons. truly not going read stands
'cause related mouse strain first identified in, humans
cells well, AgRP neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate eating. anytime
approaching food, feel excitement food anxiety,
people actually experience kind heightened anxiety. people actually get little


bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin
secreted gut. activates neurons brain various locations including
PMOC neurons, neurons wingin' it. also activates VMH
particular ways. might even activate neurons
periphery mouth actually make salivate want eat, right? Now,
know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate
desire eat acting level brain. indeed point, just
mental. hear just mental, just physical, really kind thing
'cause chemicals, brain body. stimulation neurons anticipate
feeding. stimulating arcuate nucleus neurons make want eat
AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.

really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting

try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share

lesions individuals animals make anorexic,
make not want eat all. make food aversive. means
ventromedial hypothalamus definitely interesting control station hunger
feeding satiety, doesn't really tell going deeper level. fact,
little bit confusing paradoxical. turns multiple populations
neurons there, going talk those.

00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger

promoting feeding, promoting not feeding not eating. Now,
neural component need know about, actually
mouth. area cortex, little bit
brain, called insular cortex. processes lot different kinds information.
Mostly information going inside you, called interoception.
insular cortex neurons get input mouth, touch receptors
mouth. insular cortex powerful control whether not enjoying
eating, whether not want avoid eating, whether not
enough, whether not want continue eating more. do,
believe not, touch sensation eating. familiar this. one
people, love eating much, just like mere act chewing.
know, like celery sticks enough. not crazy them, know taste fine
like chewing celery sticks, actually just like chewing them.
eat day long except not healthy that. mere act chewing
pleasurable. People chew gum feel way well. just point
gum chewing, choose something like celery cucumber slices chew
gum, provided doesn't sugar caloric content, not going drive
increased hunger. generally isn't case. eat something sugar,
find out, specific action insular cortex areas
nervous system promotes desire eat more. key point right now
know got two brain areas, ventromedial hypothalamus, involved
hunger lack hunger, sort accelerator brake feeding.
insular cortex gets input mouth, cares chewing
consistency foods sorts interesting things just tactile.
think people think touch receptors on, excuse me, taste receptors


tongue. often don't think touch tactile essence food.
thing comes mind just now gone sushi several times, people
really like urchin. don't like urchin. something kind
creeps consistency, people love it. highly individual
probably learned, probably cultural background
raised eating urchin. people love consistency touch. touch lot
whether not want eat not. Now, get back ventromedial
hypothalamus. Sometimes makes animals people want eat more, sometimes
less, going there?

00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal Importance Hormones Hunger

classic experiment done researchers took two rats, so-
called parabiosed other. meant little surgery
linked blood supply forever physically linked one
another exchange factors blood, brains separate,
mouths separate, essentially everything separately except
linked one another. walk together go places
order it. parabiosis experiment revealed something really important.
lesioned ventromedial hypothalamus one rats connected
rat, rat got very, fat, just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
one however, got thin, actually lost weight, despite consuming
amount food prior one getting lesion.
tell us? tells us something blood exchanged
two animals, blood supply linked.
tells us hormone endocrine signals involved desire eat,
hunger appetite. next, going talk endocrine
signals are, going immediately point entry points can
use. can use even not parabiosed anything. can
allow time meal frequency, predict going hungry
not. well drive appetite. Believe not, people
trying eat more. Although think far many people trying eat less
nowadays, data just point fact essentially epidemic diabetes,
type II diabetes obesity. everyone agrees now, maintaining healthy


body weight body weight composition, one best paths longevity
just feeling good actually able think. Cognitive functioning actually
linked levels adipose tissue forth. So, talk endocrine factors

00:13:08 Neurons Powerfully Control Hunger Releasing Specific Hormones

regulate feeding, hunger satiety. One really exciting things emerge
science feeding appetite last 20 years, discovery another brain
area. not just ventromedial hypothalamus, area brain called
arcuate nucleus. arcuate nucleus really fascinating sets neurons
release even incredible molecules chemicals blood.
chemicals act accelerators feeding appetite, breaks. really cool
thing can actually control molecules simple behaviors.
understand molecules are, start understand
case. control points right now order control appetite
either direction, increase decrease. So, first all, set neurons
arcuate nucleus called PMOC neurons, okay? don't want get
acronym stands for, anyway. Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin. heard melano,
tell something pigmentation skin cells hair cells,
pigmentation sort, melanin. Last episode, talked little bit
relationship light dopamine melanin. already thinking,
wait, melano means probably something system, indeed
does. Now, POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. don't want
remember acronyms terms talked about, episode far,
try remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces
appetite powerful molecule, right? just put shelf, MSH
reduces appetite. Now, another population neurons arcuate nucleus,
called AgRP neurons. truly not going read stands
'cause related mouse strain first identified in, humans
cells well, AgRP neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate eating. anytime
approaching food, feel excitement food anxiety,
people actually experience kind heightened anxiety. people actually get little


bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment

ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids

tongue. often don't think touch tactile essence food.
thing comes mind just now gone sushi several times, people
really like urchin. don't like urchin. something kind
creeps consistency, people love it. highly individual
probably learned, probably cultural background
raised eating urchin. people love consistency touch. touch lot
whether not want eat not. Now, get back ventromedial
hypothalamus. Sometimes makes animals people want eat more, sometimes
less, going there?

00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal Importance Hormones Hunger

classic experiment done researchers took two rats, so-
called parabiosed other. meant little surgery
linked blood supply forever physically linked one
another exchange factors blood, brains separate,
mouths separate, essentially everything separately except
linked one another. walk together go places
order it. parabiosis experiment revealed something really important.
lesioned ventromedial hypothalamus one rats connected
rat, rat got very, fat, just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
one however, got thin, actually lost weight, despite consuming
amount food prior one getting lesion.
tell us? tells us something blood exchanged
two animals, blood supply linked.
tells us hormone endocrine signals involved desire eat,
hunger appetite. next, going talk endocrine
signals are, going immediately point entry points can
use. can use even not parabiosed anything. can
allow time meal frequency, predict going hungry
not. well drive appetite. Believe not, people
trying eat more. Although think far many people trying eat less
nowadays, data just point fact essentially epidemic diabetes,
type II diabetes obesity. everyone agrees now, maintaining healthy


body weight body weight composition, one best paths longevity
just feeling good actually able think. Cognitive functioning actually
linked levels adipose tissue forth. So, talk endocrine factors

00:13:08 Neurons Powerfully Control Hunger Releasing Specific Hormones

regulate feeding, hunger satiety. One really exciting things emerge
science feeding appetite last 20 years, discovery another brain
area. not just ventromedial hypothalamus, area brain called
arcuate nucleus. arcuate nucleus really fascinating sets neurons
release even incredible molecules chemicals blood.
chemicals act accelerators feeding appetite, breaks. really cool
thing can actually control molecules simple behaviors.
understand molecules are, start understand
case. control points right now order control appetite
either direction, increase decrease. So, first all, set neurons
arcuate nucleus called PMOC neurons, okay? don't want get
acronym stands for, anyway. Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin. heard melano,
tell something pigmentation skin cells hair cells,
pigmentation sort, melanin. Last episode, talked little bit
relationship light dopamine melanin. already thinking,
wait, melano means probably something system, indeed
does. Now, POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. don't want
remember acronyms terms talked about, episode far,
try remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces
appetite powerful molecule, right? just put shelf, MSH
reduces appetite. Now, another population neurons arcuate nucleus,
called AgRP neurons. truly not going read stands
'cause related mouse strain first identified in, humans
cells well, AgRP neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate eating. anytime
approaching food, feel excitement food anxiety,
people actually experience kind heightened anxiety. people actually get little


bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin
secreted gut. activates neurons brain various locations including
PMOC neurons, neurons wingin' it. also activates VMH
particular ways. might even activate neurons
periphery mouth actually make salivate want eat, right? Now,
know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate
desire eat acting level brain. indeed point, just
mental. hear just mental, just physical, really kind thing
'cause chemicals, brain body. stimulation neurons anticipate
feeding. stimulating arcuate nucleus neurons make want eat
AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest

estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food

00:13:08 Neurons Powerfully Control Hunger Releasing Specific Hormones

regulate feeding, hunger satiety. One really exciting things emerge
science feeding appetite last 20 years, discovery another brain
area. not just ventromedial hypothalamus, area brain called
arcuate nucleus. arcuate nucleus really fascinating sets neurons
release even incredible molecules chemicals blood.
chemicals act accelerators feeding appetite, breaks. really cool
thing can actually control molecules simple behaviors.
understand molecules are, start understand
case. control points right now order control appetite
either direction, increase decrease. So, first all, set neurons
arcuate nucleus called PMOC neurons, okay? don't want get
acronym stands for, anyway. Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?
PMOC neurons, Proopiomelanocortin. heard melano,
tell something pigmentation skin cells hair cells,
pigmentation sort, melanin. Last episode, talked little bit
relationship light dopamine melanin. already thinking,
wait, melano means probably something system, indeed
does. Now, POMC neurons, make something called Alpha MSH. Melanocyte-
stimulating hormone, Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. don't want
remember acronyms terms talked about, episode far,
try remember M-S-H, okay? Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay? MSH reduces
appetite powerful molecule, right? just put shelf, MSH
reduces appetite. Now, another population neurons arcuate nucleus,
called AgRP neurons. truly not going read stands
'cause related mouse strain first identified in, humans
cells well, AgRP neurons. AgRP neurons stimulate eating. anytime
approaching food, feel excitement food anxiety,
people actually experience kind heightened anxiety. people actually get little


bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin
secreted gut. activates neurons brain various locations including
PMOC neurons, neurons wingin' it. also activates VMH
particular ways. might even activate neurons
periphery mouth actually make salivate want eat, right? Now,
know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate
desire eat acting level brain. indeed point, just
mental. hear just mental, just physical, really kind thing
'cause chemicals, brain body. stimulation neurons anticipate
feeding. stimulating arcuate nucleus neurons make want eat
AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.

powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major

can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting

little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,

bit resting tremor eat, even don't sort eating disorder.
kind ramping autonomic activity. largely due activity
AgRP neurons. So, activity AgRP neurons goes way animals
people starved. don't mean starved long periods time, mean
haven't eaten while. activity MSH, release MSH goes
eaten. However, things will stimulate release
things like MSH. So, just briefly experimental evidence, kill AgRP neurons,
animals people stop eating. people lesions. just stop eating,
become anorexic.

00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating

know familiar anorexia clinical term, actually term
used scientific literature pattern behavior, okay? well clinical
term course. stimulate AgRP neurons, animals people eat like
crazy. will eat point burst. just sounds horrible, just
tells accelerator eating. yes, relationship ventromedial
hypothalamus talked earlier, don't want go back just yet, will
circle back.

00:16:57 Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -
MSH)

Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, interesting hormone. thing can shut
desire eat. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, released
medial pituitary. talked pituitary last time. gland
closely positioned hypothalamus. Actually hypothalamus neurons
actually project neural connections directly pituitary, release things like
gonadotropins luteinizing hormones, stuff talked last time reference
testosterone estrogen. MSH released medial portion pituitary
stimulates desire not eat, cease eating. really interesting,
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone activated ultraviolet light. not activated
ultraviolet light skin directly pituitary, activated ultraviolet light
eyes. Now, watching podcast listening podcast


period time, heard podcasts follow Instagram,
big fan whole thing getting morning light order synchronize circadian
rhythms, et cetera, avoiding light middle night. yet another reason
getting ample light, ideally sunlight, sources UV light
eyes, stimulates MSH, shown again. keeps desire
eat appetite check, healthy ranges. also spring summer
months, animals people eat less. Now, hibernating animals different,
bear hibernate, actually. Ashley bears don't truly hibernate technically,
scientific criteria don't hibernate, go kind torpor. hibernating
animals don't eat much boroughs dens, just
wrapped little ball whatever hibernating animals do.
course going eat far less winter. unique scenario, not
hibernating animals. humans generally greater appetite cold winter
months. not just holidays abundance food
presenting with, get lot sun appetite reduced
least easier control. due part, getting ample
sunlight eyes, converted signal MSH neurons, neurons
release MSH, excuse PMOC neurons release MSH. MSH can bind
receptors, can keep break appetite check. takeaway tool
this, make sure getting enough light not just morning, throughout
day. yes, light eyes. blasting eyes sunlight
artificial light point damaging painful, won't accelerate improve
process. getting photons, ultraviolet light eyes consistently throughout
day. best accomplished not wearing sunglasses provided can
safely.

00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism

don't access enough sunlight, can artificial light.
also points old friends, blue blockers. Many people know not
huge fan blue blockers especially not daytime, block lot
UV shorter wavelength light want need create alertness, also
create release MSH medial pituitary. Now people there,
subcultures, actually inject MSH. taking MSH things similar it. not


suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection
males point actually can physically damaging genitalia.
drug, don't know whether not call drug. substance one can
regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating

AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't

information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway

material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin

know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate

AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

suggesting people that. three main consequences that. First
all, reduces appetite, no surprise there. actually using dieting drug.
kind underground. don't know legal status is. again,
not promoting people it. Two, makes very, tan, makes sense,
right? Melanocyte-stimulating hormone. third is, purportedly, never tried it,
purportedly sends libido roof, point actually distracting
activities. actually can create priapism, kind chronic erection

regulate healthy levels, sunlight perhaps artificial UV light. not heard
much treatments obesity involving getting ample sunlight getting ample UV
light, me, logic just clear. pursuing avenues,
certainly talk physician might want think
logic hangs together. Absolutely fascinating hormone, think people aren't
aware it. subcultures aware using two particular
end points, using super physiological levels. enough
'cause really don't know. talked people research. Believe not
podcast, reached people asked whether not side
effects air quotes. heard true, indeed true. again,
super physiological, controlling MSH, actually Alpha MSH levels viewing
ultraviolet light seems like interesting

00:22:30 Ghrelin: Hormone Determines Get Hungry, & Can
Control

mechanistically logical thing do, goal keep appetite check. MSH
inhibits hunger. Next, talk hormone peptide activates hunger.
really interesting one relates get hungry, addition
fact get hungry all. called ghrelin, spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. Ghrelin
released actually GI tract. main role increase desire eat.
variety mechanisms. Part stimulate
brain areas, actual neurons, make want eat. addition, creates food
anticipatory signals within nervous systems. start thinking things
happen like eat particular time day. fascinating.


Ghrelin sort like clock, hormonal clock makes want eat particular
times. Now, signal ghrelin reduced glucose levels blood. going
talk lot today glucose insulin, ways manage glucose insulin.
now simple version this, normally want glucose kind
modest range, explain range little bit. drops low, ghrelin
secreted gut. activates neurons brain various locations including
PMOC neurons, neurons wingin' it. also activates VMH
particular ways. might even activate neurons
periphery mouth actually make salivate want eat, right? Now,
know famous Pavlovian, experiments Pavlov's dogs. know,
start salivating bell. bell presented food, remove food,
just bell can stimulate salivation. become Pavlovian times.
rarely ever discussed neural pathways are. turns
hormones secreted gut can stimulate neurons create
sensation desire certain foods

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating
regular schedule skipping meal, pushing meal timing shifting
all, going ghrelin system. ghrelin going stimulate
desire eat acting level brain. indeed point, just
mental. hear just mental, just physical, really kind thing
'cause chemicals, brain body. stimulation neurons anticipate
feeding. stimulating arcuate nucleus neurons make want eat
AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get

full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not Way Around

certain times day. done experiment. somebody eats
breakfast less time day, say 8:00 plus minus 20
minutes. eat lunch 12:30 plus minus 20 minutes. say
somebody like typically skips breakfast, just eats lunch usually around
11:30 12 something like that. ghrelin secretion will start match
typically eat. that. able override low levels glucose
bloodstream, ghrelin system also gets input clock liver
linked clock hypothalamus, brain. means is, eat
regular meal times, start get hungry minutes meals times.
ever wondered stomach kind starts growl
particular time day, like, Oh must want eat, well, ghrelin.
don't know stomach growls, also tell today.
actually really interesting. not expect, not just gurgling
liquids stomach. not is. actually muscular phenomenon. So,
ghrelin secreted food anticipatory signal, get motivated go eat regular
times. So, nowadays lot interest intermittent fasting. also lot


interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

interest just meal plans schedules eat general, order
maximize one's health wellbeing. people sorts cosmetic reasons
brain reasons metabolic reasons wanting control kind stuff.
make really simple first looking extremes. people need eat every two
three hours. feel this, "I need eat every two three hours," else blood
sugar drops. general, blood sugar doesn't drop low, truly need eat
order alleviate blood sugar issue. Although sometimes can happen.
people truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar. people blood sugar
starts head towards low-ish ranges, ghrelin secreted.
people not eating clock, disruptive activates
neurons brain. people eat day twice day, tend shift
meals, know, might eat lot limited so-called feeding window,
kind interesting humans now eat talk foods ways years used
hear classes, courses, research lectures feeding animals,

00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting

know, restricted feeding windows. owe great deal gratitude Satchin
Panda, colleague mine lab San Diego Salk
Institute, really one pioneers restricted feeding window work
done beautiful work. book excellent called 'The Circadian Code'
highly recommend. done lot important work neurons retina,
control circadian timing, also relationship feeding windows health.
sort among major proponents say, circadian eating,
means eating daytime, not night intermittent fasting, restricting feeding
windows anywhere four six eight hours. use example
transition regular feeding schedule intermittent-ish fasting, although
don't really fall true intermittent fasting. one people just got
accustomed waking eating hour woke up. go
eating every three four hours eating twice day, lunch dinner, maybe couple
snacks afternoon something. first excruciating. remember thinking
like, really brutal pushing feeding. didn't think exercise unless
eaten first. now know forms exercise unless really
focused optimal performance like got hit key lifts sprint


maximum speed. maybe even can exercise faster just fine,
mainly relying sources like glycogen liver, undigested
food sometimes, gross may seem true, well body fat exercise
extremely long. means suddenly go eating

AgRP neurons. ghrelin stimulates AgRP neurons,

00:29:35 Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: 45min Per Day Rule

makes want eat. can this? means is,
want start shifting feeding schedule one not eating quite
frequently, advantages aren't just biochemistry
health related, know, cellar health related things. include not
think buy food, right? actually don't think food
day not eating often. is, gives far social flexibility,
right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat
breakfast eight o'clock plus minus 20 minutes, want start eating
first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep
stable. course, want medically safe you. not
recommending people suffer hypoglycemia suddenly disrupt blood
sugar patterns direction, wouldn't healthy. people
reasonable blood glucose levels, kind interesting kind fun play
parameters order optimize want do. sometimes
might change across year schedules. Many find great benefit flexibility
eat. Regularity eating equals regularity ghrelin secretion equals
regularity activity AgRP neurons, meaning hungry regular
intervals. something can work with, grounded deep mechanism
hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take

something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,

know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting

don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry

right? can go noon meeting can go dinner
particular time. know, guess makes kind tough want meet
somebody breakfast, 'cause dork just like sipping black coffee
like refusing everything. anyway, dork. one things
just kind work with. fact matter is, ghrelin secretion,
relationship nervous system, can shifted 45 minutes per day. Now,
going vary. so-called willpower, know. really
want just start pushing first meal shifting direction, people
might want eat early part day not evening. Trying shift
mealtimes spacing 45 minutes, neural circuits link
ghrelin system neural circuits control feeding, really can handle
form neuroplasticity. look like is, normally eat

first meal noon take maybe four five days just start pushing meal


45 minutes hour day. not quite painful. can just
take plunge just once. colleague neurosurgeon
Stanford, came lab, now Neuralink, great practice.
keeps ghrelin system random. skips one meal per day
makes external schedule dictate that. So, sometimes skips breakfast,
sometimes skips lunch, sometimes skips dinner, just skips one three
major meals per day. that, ghrelin system always kind kept off
kilter. probably also allows lot neural flexibility, call top-
control. Just knowledge, Oh, know hunger feeling isn't necessarily
hypoglycemia. case, almost certainly not. therefore feeling
activation AgRP neurons, therefore can push meal schedule
around however want. Now, mention top-down mechanisms powerful.
Belief, motivation, things can really shift neural circuits. going talk
little bit later. also people genuinely hypoglycemic
need take really good control blood sugar levels try keep

hormone neural systems,

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,

can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk

ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative

blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating

00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): Hormone Gut Says “No Mas!”

lot modern research support just said. So, MSH inhibits
feeding, makes us want eat less ghrelin makes us want eat more,
another hormone called CCK, Cholecystokinin, potent reducing levels
hunger. Now, learned CCK back undergraduate. So, well 20
years ago, first discovered. lot excitement CCK
point diet drug. know, anytime molecule chemical discovered


brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins

eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.

healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,

like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even

brain body can suppress feeding, diet industry just goes wild
think, going thing going allow people move obese
losing sorts unhealthy weight, et cetera. similar phenomenon observed
leptin. Leptin hormone made body fat signals brain
lot body fat, animals injections leptin can make fat animals thin.
lose lot adipose fat. humans, didn't work way. just studies
done leptin successful treating certain rare form diabetes,
really wasn't potent anti-obesity drug. Similarly, CCK looked
obesity drug, something reduce obesity. pretty unhappy side
effects actually caused pretty serious side effects. Now drug. However,
CCK released normal levels gut powerful effect suppressing
appetite period time. healthy direct ways activate CCK.

00:34:55 Eating Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar

Now, CCK GI tract, released GI tract. release governed
two things. One subset specialized neurons detect gut,
specific contents gut. certain elements mucosa, mucus
lining gut gut microbiome. really interesting, CCK
stimulated fatty acids particular fatty acids talk about. Amino acids,
particular amino acids talk about, well sugar. Now, put sugar
shelf moment. going talk lot sugar CCK inhibits
appetite reduces feeding, can triggered fatty acids, amino acids,
sugars, might say, well, eating lot sugars make us not want
eat more, know eating sugar makes us want eat far more.
role lot sugars. separate mechanism talk
today. So, fatty acids gut stimulate release CCK? turns
omega-3 fatty acids, ones come algae krill fish oil. talked
episode nutrition things related gut microbiome.
going revisit now. Omega-3 fatty acids Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA, either
food supplements, stimulate release CCK reduces,
least blunts appetite. not talking blunting appetite anorexic levels
don't want eat all. talking regulating appetite point
animals people don't over-consume. keeping appetite healthy level.


thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

thing stimulates CCK mentioned, amino acids. eat,
ability break different macronutrients, know, carbohydrates, fats
proteins, sugars glucose, can convert ATP stuff
Krebs cycle high school. not going go today, future
episode. amino acids one things eating for. Amino acids
can used energy process called gluconeogenesis, converting proteins
energy. amino acids can broken rebuilt things like
preparing, excuse me, repairing muscle tissue well forms cellar repair.
involved sorts things related protein synthesis. mean?
eat proper amino acids proper levels, ingest omega-3's CLA's,
Conjugated linoleic acids proper levels, get supplements,
blunting appetite. Appetite kept clamped don't become hyperphagic.
don't overeat. tend eat within healthy normal ranges. important,
people don't understand eating, basically fat
foraging amino acid foraging. several studies now shown,
people animals will essentially eat feel consumed enough omega-
3's, omega-6's, CLA's, certain amino acids. words, even not
conscious, eating trigger activation CCK. Now,
reasons shut eating too. literally, volume food gut can
large, can feel distended. physical reason obviously.
reasons, maybe just top-down control. knowledge
end meal stop 'cause go back work meeting,
tell enough. subconscious level, gut informing
brain via CCK mechanisms ingested enough need.
omega-3's CLA's certain amino acids

00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings

vital sending signal enough. Now, amino acids
actually really interesting? essential amino acids non-essential
amino acids. Among essential amino acids, one particular can trigger
release CCK potently, glutamine. Glutamine interesting
amino acid. First all, shown studies play role bolstering
immune system. can increase number killer cells immune system.


consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps
reduce activity AgRP neurons promote feeding. can see,
feeding interplay brain body. micronutrients
even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share

consumed supplement form. know, people can take it. know, teaspoon
glutamine people take glutamine throughout day, really
whatever reason, think battling off infection something sort.
Glutamine can also course derived foods. can just put
Internet, Internet search find foods rich glutamine.
ones aware off top head like cottage cheese, things
sort. foods glutamine well. threshold level glutamine
essential amino acids reached, threshold level Alpha-3,
excuse me, Omega-3 fatty acids CLA's reached, CCK released, helps

even breakdown particular nutrients, putting accelerator brake
feeding process. not just one thing. actionable standpoint, you,
probably trying get omega-3, Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
antidepressant. talked peer reviewed studies that.
healthy gut microbiome, seeking sufficient glutamine. Now,
whether not decide supplement glutamine not, you. One
reasons one might want that, again, always check
doctor, especially predisposition cancers cancer, many
cancers tumors like glutamine, something note. one reason
might want supplement glutamine consider eating foods rich
glutamine, isn't just keep appetite healthy ranges, well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings. interesting. friend,
absolute chocolate, sweets addict. grown adult, eats candy chocolate
like 14 year old kid hanging local convenience store. really
incredible. probably sugar addiction, aware
managed kick addictions. So, whatever reason, stimulates brain
body ways make want more, hates this. actually quite
frustrating him. somebody cares lot health. took
approach know many people know role glutamine,
taking teaspoon couple teaspoons glutamine several times throughout
day anytime craves sugar. indeed, glutamine, well, reduced sugar cravings.
people really kind ketogenic front, will mix little bit
half half that, guess makes taste better, little bit


chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores

that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

chalky. So, glutamine interesting properties. think people
aren't suffering adverse levels craving, making sure getting right
omega-3's can come variety sources, check episode
nutrition want learn that. CLA's, making sure
getting enough glutamine going important making sure CCK signal
gets through. one thing want mention glutamine, minor effect,
alone can small increase, excuse me, alone can increase blood sugar. not
huge increase blood glucose. gut takes proteins breaks
amino acids, essentially looking glutamine things like it,
essential amino acids well. ingest glutamine branch chain amino
acids, small real increase blood glucose.
essentially food. talking supplemental version. So, just know
glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly, especially diabetics know that. can
reduce sugar cravings. just know gut core level
forging, waiting, trying assess levels omega-3 fatty acid, conjugated
linoleic acid, glutamine, essential amino acids. essentially trying
eat get nutrients

00:43:42 Things Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing

signal can deployed brain, not really interested
eating much more. Whenever preparing episode podcast always
faced particular challenge, is, many tools offer involve
something new? know, new behavior, new exercise, supplement,
something, things sort. many related not things,
avoiding things. never really fun talk things supposed
avoid, powerful light mechanisms given topic
remiss didn't mention them. now understand hormones,
peptides like CCK ghrelin impact appetite. one particular aspect food
can powerfully impact CCK. think people, guessing 99.9% people
not aware this. highly processed foods. lot
reasons one want avoid highly processed foods. fact, interested
topic history whole foods, transitioning highly processed foods
country, highly recommend listen YouTube video Dr. Robert Lustig,


university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat

psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,

steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time

lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,

can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk

powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give

university California, San Francisco. easy find, put Stanford, Robert Lustig,
talk hosted Stanford. Gives beautiful description history this,
food industry started packing additional sugars salts, turning foods
commodities, really fascinating. no conspiracy theory just scientific
facts. really wonderful lecture. millions views, easy
find. can provide link that, will. another reason avoid highly
processed foods however, called emulsifiers. Now, many
familiar emulsifiers, even though don't know it. put
detergent laundry contains emulsifiers, goal detergent bring
together fatty molecules water molecules able dissociate break
get stains clothes things sort. lot
emulsifiers put processed foods. emulsifiers allow certain chemical
reactions occur extends shelf life foods. like candy bars
cereals, sorts things processed foods. worst
typical kind pastries see convenience store. extends chips
various kinds even meats various kinds, pack stuff meats.
names like soy lecithin things. emulsifiers bad? Okay,
lot reasons bad, reason bad
mechanisms talking today, ingest foods,
bringing emulsifiers gut. emulsifiers strip away
mucosal lining gut, actually cause neurons innervate gut,
extend little processes call axons gut, retract deeper gut.
consequence, ingesting bunch food signals like CCK never
get deployed. signals actually shut hunger never actually triggered.
so, consequence want eat far highly processed foods.
addition, go eating highly processed food non highly processed
foods, not able measure amounts amino acids, sugars, fatty acids
foods accurately. actually done structural damage micro level,
structural level damage, excuse me, mucosal lining gut. Now, can
repaired stay away highly processed foods period time.
negative effects emulsifiers quite real. So, make really clean
simple, emulsifiers highly processed foods limiting guts ability detect
foods eat therefore deploy satiety signals, signals
shut hunger. addition that, parallel mechanism play, talked


previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

previous episode remind again, neurons gut
sensing sugar, sending subconscious signal brain via
vagus nerve. neurons trigger release dopamine, makes
crave food. now got parallel signals making want eat
sugar, making unaware much sugar eaten, disrupting
inputs nervous system signal rest brain body
obtained enough fatty acids obtained enough amino acids. highly
processed foods really terrible. know, not say, know,
never enjoy processed food kind, hypocrite 'cause eat processed
foods time time. Although ones tend eat, try make
healthier variety. eating whole foods tremendous value eating highly
processed food tremendous negative impact gut gut brain axis.
so, recently paper came Cell, Cell Press journal, kind
apex Cell journals, phenomenal. paper showed that, ingesting
highly processed food leads intake not just highly processed foods
types food general. kind overeating compensation generally across
foods people consume highly processed foods. lot
reasons avoid highly processed foods. again, don't like focus much
nots, like arm tools do. think visual certain foods
emulsifiers actually stripping away critical lining gut
disrupting hormone signaling brain controlling feeding, important enough
cryptic enough, meaning hasn't talked about, works subconscious
level, important people aware can make decisions
want eat

00:49:32 “A Calorie NOT Calorie”

not want eat themselves. moving on, just want say one thing
highly processed foods. absolutely beautiful study done
colleague, Chris Gardner Stanford, exploring whether not certain diets better
others. looked vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, don't know looked
meat not, looked different forms diets, intermittent fasting, et
cetera. essentially found that, whichever diet people adhered to, whichever one
followed, equivalent others. Provided followed it, lost


equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn
please refer Lustig lecture. also spells non-processed foods
far economical terms just level household individual well
societal level.

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.

powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major

can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk

potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give

equivalent amount weight. really wasn't strong effect food type
pattern eating, et cetera. However, study like that, adherence high
people part study. many people, ability adhere
certain eating plan one most, not powerful determinants whether
not given diet meaning nutritional plan works. Now, thing highly
processed foods however, really diabolical. truly says, think
recent data cell metabolism journals really proves that, calorie not
calorie. absolutely absurd emulsifiers contents
highly processed foods. fact, data humans points this.
took in-patient adults, total control food intake.
received either ultra processed unprocessed diets 14 days, short study.
diets matched calories, sugar, fat, fiber, macronutrients. everything else
matched. Just processed non-processed major variable. basically
found, people eating processed food diet happened
eat much more, right? period putting either diet
clamping variables. eat much more, body weight
changes much more. body weight changes, couldn't
accounted just increased calories. So, bottom line highly processed
foods just bad you. increase weight gain. disrupt lining gut
way disrupts things like CCK proper satiety signals. contain
bunch things, particular sugars, things well, disrupt not just
hormonal systems also neural systems control desire eat diet
done. just many reasons highly processed foods terrible,
can explain lot ill health effects seen last 50 years not
just United States, world. enormous increase diabetes,
juvenile diabetes. just remarkable far path diet gone.
clear, almost smoking gun cause is. like learn

00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia

Really interesting stuff, highly recommend check out. now move


hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,

full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,

hormones regulate hunger satiety, particular insulin. Now,
probably heard insulin before. Insulin thing lacking type diabetics,
inject insulin whenever eat. reason that,
eat foods broken glucose. order
shuttle glucose appropriate tissues body, also keep glucose levels
check, need insulin. simplest way think insulin glucose
eat, food broken sugars, true whether not fats
sugars, eventually proteins, oxidized fuels say.
fuels can used name fuel implies energy, eventually made
ATP. bunch biochemical steps not going go today,
essentially works. break food glucose. Now,
ketogenic, talk little bit. general, eat, food turned
glucose. blood sugar needs kept particular range. Hypoglycemic means
low, hyperglycemic means high. called euglycemic E-U, glycemic,
healthy range. Now, healthy ranges are, general healthy range,
euglycemic range, 70 hundred nanograms per deciliter.
aren't walking around glucose monitor. are, not.
important question us address right now, important
glucose kept particular level? understand that, keeping glucose
check starts rationale behind ways start make lot
sense. reason is, glucose levels get high way
cells particular neurons, interact glucose, high levels glucose can damage
neurons. can actually kill them. can start getting called peripheral,
excuse me, neuropathies. One symptoms forms diabetes people
start losing sensation touch fingers hands feet,
can start going blind. diabetic retinopathies. important, insulin
manage glucose levels. Now, also type II diabetes insulin
secreted pancreas, people insulin insensitive. disruption
receptors insulin insensitivity isn't quite no insulin all,
parallels mechanisms. Now, type diabetes often picked
someone sudden weight loss, not processing blood
sugar way before. Type II diabetes often, although not always
associated overweight obesity. challenging
conditions. Type II diabetes almost always can managed managing one's weight.


course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based

course prescription drugs supplements can help manage
those. going talk that. people don't diabetes,
important thing manage glucose, keep euglycemic range.
number different ways that. behavioral,
diet based, based supplements

00:56:12 Order Eat Foods Matters: Managing Blood Glucose & Glucagon

prescription drugs. talk now. eat, particular
eat carbohydrates, blood glucose goes up. eat fats, blood glucose goes far
less degree. eat proteins, depending protein, will eventually
broken fuel assembled amino acid chains protein synthesis
repair tissues bodily functions. glucose goes kept
range. hungry, secrete different hormone called
glucagon. glucagon's main role, pull stores energy liver
muscles. depleted, eventually tap body fat, okay? So,
people typical blood glucose range, 70 100 euglycemic
range. So, two kind push pull systems going think now
keep simple, insulin system managing glucose, got
glucagon system pulling energy liver muscles immediate fuel.
eventually pull fuel body fat active long time
glycogen stores depleted close depleted. mean?
lot important biochemistry lot important cellar processes involved
whether not anabolic catabolic. Whether not breaking things
building things up. talk feeding simpler way, however. weave
tools manage blood glucose, keep check, that. So, say
meal meal consisted rice, carbohydrate, meat fish, say
piece salmon, vegetable, fibrous vegetable like asparagus
cabbage something like that. eat once, know, take
bite one, bite other, going mix up. know, one these,
ends place kind people, mix up. experience
increase insulin increase blood glucose moderately fast. going
increase pretty quickly. remarkable, order consume
macro-nutrient pretty profound influence rate insulin glucose


secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days

First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get

hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin
hot chili peppers will lower blood glucose. list goes on,
powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share

secretion blood quickly levels rise. will make really
simple. eat rice first, glucose rise sharp spike,
especially doesn't contain fats slow absorption. Now, might good
hungry want get increase glucose. fact, reason
often served bread meals, is... sometimes bread
butter, chips meals appetizers, designed get blood glucose
going high big steep increases blood glucose tend promote desire
consume glucose. also relates dopamine system way
something tasty mouth sugar gut fats sugars mouth,
trigger activation lot systems brain body consume
whatever whatever available you. So, basic idea eating
carbohydrates and/or fats early meal will give steep rise blood glucose.
However, eat fibrous thing first, lot chewing, not big rise
blood glucose general there's... Unless laid sugar. something
just talking vegetable, fibrous vegetable, will actually blunt
release glucose eat fish rice. believe not will actually
blunt glucose increase rice cause. Now, not talking
neurotically eating macro-nutrient separately sequence. just trying give
picture happening ordinarily. means is, feel lot
food related anxiety, feel one people can kind sense
like blood sugar increasing quickly, lot people can sense this,
people can't, lot well manage blood sugar well
psychological factors. yes, family historical reasons,
know, got friends lot siblings, sit eat
really suppress desire not beat everyone else table take
food. sort like not... hard understand plenty go
around, upbringing. psychological top-down effects. lot
psychology around food geared towards getting people relaxed
eat sorts things. blood sugar effects real just cellar basic
biochemistry body manages sugars ingested blood.
mean? means want steep increase glucose, very,
hungry, eat carbohydrate laid food first, eat bunch
macronutrients combined. like hamburger sandwich,
bread, whatever's sandwich altogether, usually protein vegetables


well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,
protein carbohydrate. will notice blood glucose will rise
steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

well. want modest increase glucose want blunt
increase glucose, the, least fibrous thing first,

steadily, achieve satiety earlier meal. least won't get
huge peak sort Thanksgiving meal effect. international,
don't celebrate Thanksgiving time year where... used one-time
year two times year Americans give permission eat
enormous meals. Now seems happen lot often. effect
full yet hungry more, blood glucose gone
roof triggered number mechanisms. also usually
lot alcohol consumption, alcohol sugar will increase blood
glucose very, sharply. depends alcohol, alcohols sugar
others. basically trying avoid steep increases blood sugar.
order eat foods enormous impact that. thing
enormous impact

01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4

long shallow, steep curve glucose is, depends whether
not recently moving, moving start moving eat. turns
blood glucose levels can modulated very, powerfully movement.
kind intense exercise, even just walking jogging, cycling anything
eat blood glucose levels will dampened somewhat.
release something called, people call GLUT4, sounds like
glutton. people call GLUT4. things involved shuttling
glucose particular cells body, namely toward muscle glycogen stores
away body fat stores. sequestering glucose blood.
point that, somebody struggles blood sugar regulation, addition
getting body weight healthy range, sorts things
doing, key thing try get movement, sometime circuit
meal. Now, people can actually eat walk time, although
time. Not trying regulate blood sugar just 'cause tend
busy. eat drive, [mumbles] busy. Busy not giving podcast,
sleeping, eating, except early part day fast. bottom line


that, you, instance take 30 minute walk meal, blood glucose
will blunted ways beneficial. exercised recent hours
meal, can beneficial. order consume foods beneficial.
things can consume can also adjust blood glucose
levels. talk those, thought important really tamp
not just eat, talked before, also order eat
things, believe not, whether not combine macro-nutrients,
carbohydrates, proteins fats fibrous vegetables. whether not
moved recently. higher intensity movement, greater GLUT4 increase,
blood glucose will blunted shuttle
glycogen muscle stores. even just moving meal, even just calm easy
walk,

01:04:50 Sugar Stimulates Appetite

can really adjust ways blood sugar regulated better. don't want
perseverate processed foods, hidden sugars thing much. understanding
now little bit insulin glucose work, can probably imagine
hidden sugars attractive thing standpoint processed food
manufacturers. can put sugar can't even taste, sugar
going amplify amount glucose, going increase rate glucose
increase bloodstream going promote feeding. case,
really tricked. not actually reaching additional
appetizer blood glucose going up. food ate actually
increasing appetite eat it. positive feedback loop.

01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable Specific Exercises, Power Insulin
Sensitivity

don't want demonize already have, aware
things happening level bloodstream brain.
thing like address moment, notion stable blood sugar versus lay bile
blood sugar unstable blood sugar. people just stable blood sugar.
can go long periods time without eating feel fine. people get really shaky,


really jittery, and/or eat, feel really keyed up. Sometimes even
sweat. Sometimes vision will go blurry. can actually
become hyperglycemic. effects experience
hyperglycemic early warning signs kinds things damage neurons
lead really terrible stuff talked like peripheral neuropathies.
Now, takes time things occur, neuropathies occur.
whether not blood sugar place whether not stable, can
impacted number things. One things exercise. days
lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways
going repack glycogen shuttle things towards restorage foods not
adipose tissue, not fat, taking glucose making fuels can
access later high intensity activity. mention one
advantages high intensity interval training weightlifting various kinds,
causes long standing increases basal metabolic rate. don't want go far
path going entire month human performance athletic
performance. not just increases muscle increase metabolism,
muscle burns energy types tissues, except brain, truly
burns energy. Anyway main reason basal metabolic rate
is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people
probably exercise days week, not every day week.
goal manage blood glucose goal manage metabolic
factors control repackaging glycogen

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting

evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut

lot interest call zone two cardio, kind steady state cardio,
can just nasal breathe even pretty high output, maybe
conversation. Although huge proponent nasal breathing
exercise, forms exercise especially zone two cardio, probably shouldn't
talking cardio unless absolutely essential. periods
zone two cardio lasts anywhere 30 minutes hour sometimes
endurance athletes, can create positive effects blood sugar regulation,
people can sit enjoy whatever is, hot fudge sundae, whatever
high sugar content food is. blood glucose management good. insulin
sensitivity high, good thing, can manage blood glucose
point doesn't really make shaky, doesn't disrupt you. know,
say nothing weight-related issues adipose fat gain, et cetera,
separate issue people vary there. basically zone two cardio 30
60 minutes, three four times week

01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism

makes blood sugar really stable, attractive thing variety
reasons. flip side, high intensity interval training resistance training AKA weight
training, good stimulating various molecules promote repackaging
glycogen. sprints, heavy weight lifting, circuit type weightlifting provided
reasonable degree resistance, going trigger sorts mechanisms
going encourage body shuttle glucose back glycogen, converting
glycogen, muscle tissue, restock liver, et cetera. Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes time. know, couple sets tricep extensions
crunches, not depleting glycogen. Glycogen depleting workouts


high intensity. Generally less hour so, sort
going lead big increases kinds enzymes metabolic pathways

is. Well, high-intensity training. sprints, high intensity
interval training different kinds, weight training, also effect
increasing thermogenesis even long completed exercise.
long tail. kind post exercise metabolic effect also beneficial. not
either or, really high intensity interval training resistance training.
things sort good one reason. zone two cardio good
reasons. now can see just healthy thing people

ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually

Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol

either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow

huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment

main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower

not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood

berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting

01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, &
Zinc

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect
reducing blood glucose. Things like L-carnitine, something talked
podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give

magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia
impacts gut microbiome either direction. Many things consume
small amounts Stevia them. love know anyone aware
quality peer reviewed research, whether not Stevia impacts gut microbiome
similarly differently artificial sweeteners. Please let know. Please send
references. really appreciate put comment section YouTube
elsewhere. Comment section YouTube best place. Stevia seems
lower blood glucose little bit, makes kind attractive artificial sweetener
one going use artificial sweeteners. remember, sweet taste stimulates
desire eat, will increase blood glucose.

01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity

guessing probably cancel out. think logically
things. Vitamin B3, B vitamins indeed stimulate appetite
triggering increases blood glucose, vitamin B3 particular. don't know B6 does.
Things like zinc seem lower blood glucose. there've enormous
number things tested roles blood glucose. Apple cider
vinegar, anything acidic. well-known now kind acidity,


lemon juice lime juice, Apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
can also effects not talking today. kind
interesting movement now towards creating sort people talk
becoming alkaline, know, these... hate break don't
really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting

ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly
potent. then, excuse me. number things like capsaicin

powerful one absolutely berberine Metformin, really heavy caliber stuff.
ones mentioned minor effects.

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver,
Adrenals

encouraging excess glucose not get diverted body fat stores. haven't
talked lot lipids today, today's discussion
hormones insulin dominant hormone terms mobilizing managing
glucose body, least people. fats important. just
little anecdote fats think will useful thinking want
manage call LDL HDL ratios. deserving entire episode,
many, perhaps even several episodes. may familiar LDLs
HDLs, may not. LDL low density lipoprotein. one
don't want high. Castillo's dreaming, barking. loves forms


cholesterol just Castillo dreaming. LDLs ones want keep
low. don't want go excessively high. HDLs, high density lipoproteins
ones so-called healthy lipoproteins. fine good.
might ask yourself, doing? actual role things,
want healthy levels HDL not much LDL? Well, one reasons
is, fats don't like water, right? hydrophobic. yet need move fats
bloodstream, tissues body need fats. need cholesterols, they're...
last episode talked cholesterol precursor sex steroid hormones,
estrogen, testosterone hormones well. Well, HDL LDL, actually
coat fats allow transported bloodstream. number
things well. HDL, key component delivery system brings
fats liver, ovaries, testes, adrenals. words, adequate
levels HDL good, allows fats delivered tissues
manufactured testosterone, estrogen, cortisol healthy levels liver.
LDLs high happening not getting fats correct
tissues. can get buildup fats like fatty liver disease things
can happen. high sugar content can even lead fatty liver conditions
starting happen actually first time human history perhaps
aware anyway. starting see liver conditions normally
associated severe alcoholism starting come sugar content.
mean? means keep LDL HDL ratios proper. want
HDLs order deliver fatty molecules tissues use cholesterol order
manufacturer hormones. keep LDLs HDLs proper ratios?
Well, lot people don't realize this, debate dietary cholesterol
relationship LDL HDL ratios, barbed wire debate. don't want get
right now. still lot open questions much dietary cholesterol
impacts LDL HDL ratios. don't want get now, not taking stance
either way. clear, highly elevated glucose, consuming
much sugar not managing glucose body mechanisms
talking now, can also negatively impact LDL, HDL ratios.
managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar, making sure
don't lay much body fat, making sure metabolism stays high
making sure not getting jittery meals. also making sure
creating enough molecules HDL not many molecules LDL,


going disrupt delivery things organs body allow
make healthy levels testosterone, estrogen, forth. wasn't clear, let
make ultra simple. want healthy levels HDL, want low levels LDL,
ovaries will allow fats need get ovary produce
estrogen, get there. testes, will allow fats cholesterol
molecules need order manufacture testosterone get testes.
well, order proper adrenal function

01:15:00 Prescription Compounds Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin

proper liver function, want HDL LDL healthy correct levels. now
talked lot behavioral tools underlying biological mechanisms
justify tools particular circumstances. Now, like turn supplements
prescription drugs regulate hormone systems, controlling feeding satiety.
huge number these. powerful effects others.
two want describe getting lot attention recently.
First all, prescription drug Metformin, developed treatment
diabetes. works potently reduce blood glucose. dramatic effects
lowering blood glucose. Metformin involves changes mitochondrial action liver.
main way depleting reducing blood glucose.
so-called AMPK pathway, increases insulin sensitivity overall. Metformin
powerful drug. fact, surprised many people sought out, given
people aware sought not diabetic. think
diabetics seems useful drug. non-diabetics, can also course, lower
blood glucose. also potential make people hypoglycemic, genuinely
hypoglycemic. So, really need approach Metformin caution. get little
concern hear people blasting Metformin, simply fasted states
low blood sugar states healthy. pharmacologically can long standing
effects. really want approach caution. Now, comparable drug,

01:16:45 Berberine: Potent Glucose Buffer Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels,
Canker Sores

really called drug. non-prescription, also fairly prominent


use called berberine, B-E-R B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct. berberine
really interesting compound. actions much mimic Metformin. talk
berberine second. Berberine actually comes various plants tree bark.
sold supplement stores, sold online. is, far know unregulated,
powerful. going experiment berberine, definitely want talk
doctor want approach caution. also works activate so-called
AMPK pathway. AMPK way stands Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway. think
enough nomenclature. activates certain pathway associated fasting
low blood glucose. effects berberine far can tell, looking
literature, similar not identical Metformin. Now, number studies
many. just going review major
effects. always, invite check examine.com. wonderful website
can put supplement compound biological goal matter. will
list various effects human effect matrix. studies humans,
available. will tell whether not strong effects weak effects
modest effects. will point specific subject population, wonderful
resource. berberine, not surprisingly strong effects lowering blood
glucose. four studies this. fact, say berberine one
not effective supplements lowering blood glucose. talks
dosages there. Although just mention tried berberine, dosages
typical bottle supplements, much higher needed.
took berberine, two things happened, first all, got pretty splitting headache. gave
pretty vicious headache. no, almost immediately. thing
is, became hypoglycemic. order get blood sugar back up, think ate
something like 10 donuts didn't feel like ingested much sugar.
really kind weird. hyperphagic sugar. craving sugar, craving sugar
thirsty well. so, don't want promote bad behavior, know
certain people use overeaten sugars cheat
days, something personally just not fan of. want keep blood
sugar check know going consume huge meal. take
berberine keep blood glucose clamped. that. strong effects.
Three peer reviewed studies HbA1c levels. HbA1c something can
measured blood test. sort average readout blood sugar levels


previous two three months, sometimes shorter period. mostly
HbA1c about. So, radically decreases blood sugar levels. actually lowers
cholesterol. acts remember liver, liver involved cholesterol
metabolism. remember sugars, blood glucose, dietary fats. Perhaps
still heavily debated terms blood total cholesterol HDL LDL
regulated. seems lower total cholesterol, seems like lowers HDL
LDL parallel. interesting. One study showed minor increase HDL, so-
called good cholesterol. Insulin levels dropped, not surprising. Another study showed
slight decrease LDL, though seem kind minor. kind interesting
one, just help remember berberine fact comes tree bark, isn't
trigger enough remember it. Direct contact berberine canker sores seems
eliminate canker sores quickly, kind cool. not canker sores
years dig down, extremely painful. don't like those. kind
interesting, study references there. find amazing
compounds exist. got prescription drug Metformin, got
berberine, stuff tree bark, effects essentially equivalent
one another. again, not promoting use even exploration,
compounds exist, there. check examine.com like learn
more. Certainly reading, homework, start just popping
stuff. hypoglycemia hyperglycemia, especially careful also
understand dosages dose requirements vary. go path,
really approach things carefully. Always start lowest amount get
away with. me, headache thing just made no-go. keep bottle
full disclosure, odd chance feel like eating ton doughnuts. not
much not ingesting calories, just don't like feeling
hyperglycemic, blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

love donuts. things impact blood glucose supplement form. Chromium
shown 29 studies minor, want emphasize minor effect

podcast terms relationship power output ATP production


aerobic anaerobic exercise, well sperm quality egg quality. talked
long ago. Things like Panax ginseng can positive effects on,
say, can effects reducing blood glucose slightly. don't want give valence
judgment whether not positive negative. something interesting
know about. Caffeine reliably shown increase blood
glucose just little bit, okay? always thought caffeine drop blood
glucose, actually can increase blood glucose just slightly. Things like magnesium.
talked magnesium tool enhancing passage sleep, particular
magnesium threonate bisglycinate. Magnesium can also modest reduction
blood glucose. just trying get impression, everything reduces blood
glucose, certainly not case. couple episodes ago
discussing nutrition talked artificial sweeteners, sucralose, aspartame,
NutraSweet. generic names. might brand names
negative effects gut microbiome supported
number studies. one artificial sweetener, stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A, seems
lower blood glucose just slightly. still can't find data whether not Stevia

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,
understand not done anymore? can also just reflect far
come terms medical profession itself. ability measure things
blood measure things urine without ask ants urine sweeter

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways

01:35:19 Summary & Notes Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone

leptin levels, glucose levels, glucagon levels ways serves you,
might want try. again, covered enormous amount material, focused
hormones regulate feeding, hunger, one feels don't need eat,
so-called satiety, enough. always, covered lot, not
exhaustive information related topic. just vast. instance,
not talk thyroid hormone, extremely important hormone pathway
body brain. going episode related thyroid tools
regulate thyroid, promise. seen episode, will able digest
material far ease. also didn't talk fact testosterone
estrogen can impact blood glucose ways opposite one another.
estrogen levels high, appetite tends reduced. testosterone levels


high, appetite tends increase. sorts interesting interplays
various hormones. much deep dive now. Right now, just
focused today mainly things like ghrelin, things like, Melanocyte simulating
hormone, incredible powerful hormone can suppress appetite. things like
Cholecystokinin comes gut can suppress appetite. things like food
emulsifiers. fact eating amino acids seeking, even
though might not realize it. also seeking particular fatty acids
particular, conjugated linoleic acids Omega-3's. tried give
number actionable tools. Many behavioral. based
supplements even prescription drugs. Again, always best health,
company healthcare professional. not physician, don't
prescribe anything. professor, profess lot things. try share
think best high quality peer reviewed literature.

compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort

GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat

really want body alkaline. want stay right pH else
start... conditions make alkaline. don't want acidic
alkaline. see beverage something purports ingesting
beverage going make alkaline, absolutely false. no
evidence that, impossible biochemically. just marketing. nonetheless
ingesting foods acidic can make slight adjustments pH gut
ways can slow alter absorption foods can blunt blood glucose. can
try sometime want, ever feeling kind sugared like ate
something much sugar. can drink small amount lemon juice mixed
water lime juice, notice will blunt kind hyperglycemic effect just
little bit. Again, don't want use medical tool, effect fairly

01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones

want mention sure curious
ketogenic diet. going entire episode ketosis brain
body, ketogenic diet shown 22 studies notable decrease
blood glucose. not surprising, essence ketogenic diet
consuming little zero foods promote big spikes insulin
glucose. consume enough protein, protein can converted
glucose, course, gluconeogenesis. ketogenic diet strong
support role regulating blood sugar, glucose. specific effects
ketogenic diet, one particular effect address later mention now,
is, ability ketogenic diet adjust thyroid hormone levels ways
make return eating carbohydrates ketosis long,
don't manage fibroid carbohydrates well, shown well.


going dive deep ketosis future episode. ketonistas
don't worry, certainly nothing ketogenic diet. actually don't
anything particular nutrition plan. know works me, least
stage life. update need to. simply trying get much
information possibly can, can navigate landscape

01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine

way keeping particular goals. now understand lot
blood sugar managed, ways can manage better
depending particular needs. also good opportunity us look back
medical literature, really points just far come
terms understanding important mechanisms. points us direction
actionable protocols. diabetes, huge increases blood glucose,
no insulin, known early 1500 BC, just
incredible. way physicians understood certain people high blood
glucose without actually knowing blood glucose was, take
urine particular patients, find ants preferably move toward
consume urine certain patients not others. understood
something urine correlated weight loss
probably unfortunate health symptoms people experiencing.
knew something blood urine. might asking
yourself, wait, urine. tell every kid meet, two things. tell kid,
brain here, make point head. tell them, know what?
know urine actually filtered blood? usually go, [grunts]. get
parental permission first. adults don't realize urine
actually just filtered blood. see blood urine, problem.
want filter blood, urine filtered blood. Now, business measuring
blood sugar urine something lasted way beyond early
stages 1500 BC. turns late 1674, physicians Oxford university
figuring pathologically high levels blood glucose analyzing urine.
again, measuring sweetness urine, medical fact.
taking urine samples different patients, tasting them.
developed intuitive sense excessively sweet urine relative


urines tasted. medical
profession seeking medical profession,

01:31:08 Power GLP-1 & Yerba Mate Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes

ask oneself, urine sweeter. indeed making progress species.
close today want talk one tool many will
probably find useful. certainly have, big consumer caffeine, although don't
consume ton it, consume consistently. big consuming Mate,
strong caffeinated tea. generally early day. Although delay
two hours wake reasons talked previous episode,
maintain nice arc alertness focus. drink black coffee well, mushroom
coffee well, love stuff. Mate, also called Yerba Mate, interesting
compound unlike coffee, shown increase something called
glucagon like peptide GLP1. increase leptin levels. Now, didn't talk lot
glucagon today. Glucagon really elevated fasting state. mentioned sort
opposite insulin kind rough terms one way think it.
GLP1, glucagon-like peptide one, increased ingesting Mate acts
pretty nice appetite suppressant. Now, not trying suppress appetite. like eat
mentioned before. works really well stimulate brain give
level alertness lot things coffee does. also contains
electrolytes. meaning neurons brain run variety factors,
electrical activity chemical transmission, et cetera, require adequate levels
sodium potassium magnesium. So, learn biology
physiology action potential, firing neuron, something teach every first
year neuroscience student, happy teach interested. hear
sodium rushing cells potassium entering leaving cells order
allow neurons communicate. Electrolytes critically important function
nervous system. many things act diuretics, promote excretion water,
like caffeine, can also take electrolytes along particular sodium.
sometimes lightheadedness brain fog people experience, isn't just


electrolytes low kind balance. like Mate
electrolytes, caffeine. stimulates release glucagon-like
peptide GLP1, big help extending early morning fasting
window noon eat first meal. also just tastes really good.
don't drink gourd even though Argentine lineage. gourd
just kind inconvenience, drink mug. no promotion here.
no relationship Yerba Mate plantations companies, just happen really like
stuff. fact glucagon-like peptide one enriched released
drink Mate. fact GLP1 can regulate blood sugar ways keep
blood sugar called euglycemic, not high, not low mode, one
reason ingesting Mate attractive me. go South America, well,
see especially among Oregonians, also Argentines, people actually carry
thermos stuff around bring meals restaurants. just
considered cultural convention, not unusual see that. don't see
much States happen really love stuff. brew own,
economical way it. really enjoy it. can little bitter
people. real key want know, Mate trick not use water
really boiling hot. go just shy boil doesn't kind
tobacco like really acidic flavor it. just little bit sweeter, although not quite
sweet. So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can manage healthy ways
