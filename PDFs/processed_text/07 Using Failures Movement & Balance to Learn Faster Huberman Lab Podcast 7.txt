balance allow us change nervous system. turns movement
balance actually provide windows portals ability change nervous
system way want, even changes not learning new movements
learning balance. soon understand why. So, today, going
talk lot basic science neuroplasticity. promise not use excessive
nomenclature. There'll little bit, try make clear possible.
also going talk lot protocols tools scientific literature points
support changing nervous system, again, not just sake learning new
motor movements balance better, feel differently
particular experiences, past, present, future, well learn faster.
not going discuss hacks, word loath, not going discuss gimmicks,
going discuss mechanism scientific data tools
mechanisms scientific data point

06:20 Nerves Muscles

can tailor practices around learning specific needs goals.
begin just examining big picture question is, brain control
behavior? hope everyone immediately thinking yes. brain
nervous system, really say, 'cause brain just one component
nervous system, controls behavior. that? Well, couple
different levels that. First all, talking movement, behavior
generally means movement, talking movement, two categories
neurons important think context neuroplasticity. First
all, called lower motor neurons. motor neurons live
spinal cord. aficionados there, might headed
medical school just want learn anatomy, live ventral horn
spinal cord. doesn't matter don't want know that, just know
things called lower motor neurons. neurons
spinal cord extend wire call axon peripheral nervous
system, body. neurons connect muscle. send electrical
potentials allow muscles twitch contract. little point fact,
actually, don't muscle memory. no thing muscle memory.
Muscles dumb. don't know anything, don't history, don't


memory, don't know anything. neurons control muscles
firing patterns information motor patterns stored.
ability walk not muscle memory, neural memory. Now, lower motor neurons,
smarter muscle speak, not brilliant motor
neurons. generally involved told, told
two sources. circuits brainstem, kind
around neck deep brain, called central pattern generators.
sometimes called CPGs. Central pattern generators allow us generate
repetitive patterns movement. inhaling exhaling, inhaling exhaling
subconsciously controlled central pattern generator. just means collection
neurons. really want know, called pre-Botzinger neurons
discovered Jack Feldman colleagues UCLA. neurons brainstem
send information phrenic nerve control diaphragm. goes inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale. don't think that. think
change durations inhales exhales change up,
motor neurons control just responding brain telling do.
central pattern generators include things like walking. right limb-left limb,
right limb-left limb pattern normally associate walking learned
childhood, central pattern generators, sometimes called CPGs, tell lower
motor neurons, "Fire. Now fire, now fire." literally saying, "Right, left,
right left." marching orders brainstem lower motor neurons.
lower motor neurons told. obedient little soldiers
told, job make muscles contract specific
times. Okay. simple. upper motor neurons. upper
motor neurons actually reside motor cortex, way top brain.
involved sending signals deliberate action. send signals lower
motor neurons effectors, ones actually control muscles,
upper motor neurons ones send specific signals. instance,
signals allow make cup coffee morning deliberately
engage kind behavior. Now, can probably make cup coffee
morning without think much. almost reflexive now,
means lot information perform particular movement
passed off circuitry now less brainstem
motor cortex. Now, giving detail? Well, want change motor


patterns, know circuitry changes possible
know changes likely occur. also need know,
signal brain nervous system change necessary? just pause
there, return initial question started with, is, brain control
behavior? answer yes, now know how. upper motor neurons,
lower motor neurons, got things called central pattern generators
connection muscle. go, just got, basically,
equivalent introduction college lecture motor control nervous
system. point today plasticity. can leveraged order
open magical thing call plasticity order access changes
emotional experience, belief system, ability remember use
specific kinds information say math, language, et cetera? Well, not
going tell

12:00 Exercise alone wonâ€™t change brain

need go running need go biking, simply going motor
patterns going open plasticity hate tell this, beneficial
exercise is, not open plasticity unless certain things. will tell
exactly certain things today. clear, think exercise wonderful
healthy, can improve cardiovascular function, maintain strength, bone density,
good stuff. just working exercise various kinds will not change
nervous system. will maintain it, can certainly improve health metrics,
not going open window plasticity. question need ask
can behavior change brain? already agree brain can change behavior,
can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided behavior
different enough specific ways behaviors already know
perform.

12:58 Behavior will change brain

Let repeat that. Can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided
behavior different enough sorts behaviors already know
perform. should've added word well. can't obviously perform


behavior don't know perform don't know yet.
key element accessing neuroplasticity frankly don't see
general discussion neuroplasticity.

13:30 Remembering wrong things

general discussion neuroplasticity learning, hear
gimmicks using different ways remember lots people's names arranging
things first letters mnemonics kind stuff, which, frankly,
feels really gimmicky. think look super learners, tend people
process say extreme memory. people extreme memory,
generally, literature shows us, pretty poor things. don't think us
interested walking around knowing remember everything. fact,
interesting studies looking humans over-remember, suffer
tremendously remember sorts things, like number top
receipt bodega bought Coca-Cola 10 years ago. useless
information people. don't well life, really. goal isn't
remember everything, goal selective brain changes.
talk brain changes, want highlight adaptive changes. whole
category things going discuss talk traumatic brain injury
dementia, topic future episode, things happen
damaged nervous system missing neurons. But, today, really want
talk something think near dear many hearts,
behaviors can engage access neuroplasticity

15:00 Behavior gate plasticity

can apply plasticity specific things want learn
unlearn. important don't want people get impression
really talking learning bunch motor movements. may athlete,
might not athlete. might want learn dance, might not.
might want learn dance get better remembering learning
languages, instance, unlearning difficult emotional experience, meaning
want remove emotional load particular memory experience.


talking today using behavior gate enter states mind body
allow access plasticity. talk different kinds plasticity
available us.

15:45 Types Plasticity

will point directly towards type protocols engage
change better, so-called adaptive plasticity. something
called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity just internal
representation outside world. map auditory space, believe
not, meaning neurons respond something right happens,
like [snaps fingers] snapping fingers right. can't snap well
left, whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak left
side. that, different neurons respond those. map
visual space. Certain neurons seeing things certain portions visual space
not others. map motor space, meaning move limbs
particular directions, know limbs even can't see them,
called proprioceptive feedback. knowledge
limbs are. fact, people lack certain neurons proprioceptive feedback,
poor controlling motor behavior. get injured lot. actually terrible
situation. got representations inside maps motor
commands. know that, instance, want reach grab pen front
me, need generate certain amount force. rarely overshoot, rarely miss
pen. maps motor world maps sensory world merged.
way create plasticity create mismatches errors perform things.
think amazing important feature neuroplasticity

17:32 Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

highly underappreciated. way create plasticity send signals
brain something wrong, something different, something isn't
achieved. think will completely reframe way people think
plasticity. us think plasticity as, "Okay, going get optimal
learning state flow, suddenly going able things


wish do." Well, hate break you, flow expression
already know do. not state learning. willing go bat
flo-wa-nis-tas want challenge one. Flow
expression nervous system capabilities already embedded us. Errors
making errors sync like nervous system
cued distinct biological mechanisms something isn't going right. And,
therefore, certain neurochemicals deployed signal neural circuits
change. talk experiments support just said. 'Cause
tell making errors route
shaping nervous system performs better better better. not
going tell last rep set hit failure gym anything like
neuroplasticity. hear pushing point cliff just
can't function anymore, signal. not signal. distinct
neuromuscular phenomenon bears zero resemblance takes get
neuroplasticity. talk errors making errors
triggers release chemicals allow us not just learn thing
motor sense, play piano, dance, et cetera, also creates
environment, milieu within brain, allows us go learn couple
uncouple particular emotion experience, better language learning, better
mathematical learning. really fundamental aspect built.
look it, actually straightforward. series logical steps
learn open hatches, becomes straightforward deploy. Last
episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking
question 20-year-old 15-year-old, "What can now really going
enhanced brain?" guess simple answer aside, get
broadest education can possible. means math, chemistry, physics,
literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures
passion excitement, put ton additional effort there.


recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need

lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat

given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach

carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking

mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped

handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

memory, don't know anything. neurons control muscles
firing patterns information motor patterns stored.
ability walk not muscle memory, neural memory. Now, lower motor neurons,
smarter muscle speak, not brilliant motor
neurons. generally involved told, told
two sources. circuits brainstem, kind
around neck deep brain, called central pattern generators.
sometimes called CPGs. Central pattern generators allow us generate
repetitive patterns movement. inhaling exhaling, inhaling exhaling
subconsciously controlled central pattern generator. just means collection
neurons. really want know, called pre-Botzinger neurons
discovered Jack Feldman colleagues UCLA. neurons brainstem
send information phrenic nerve control diaphragm. goes inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale. don't think that. think
change durations inhales exhales change up,
motor neurons control just responding brain telling do.
central pattern generators include things like walking. right limb-left limb,
right limb-left limb pattern normally associate walking learned
childhood, central pattern generators, sometimes called CPGs, tell lower
motor neurons, "Fire. Now fire, now fire." literally saying, "Right, left,
right left." marching orders brainstem lower motor neurons.
lower motor neurons told. obedient little soldiers
told, job make muscles contract specific
times. Okay. simple. upper motor neurons. upper
motor neurons actually reside motor cortex, way top brain.
involved sending signals deliberate action. send signals lower
motor neurons effectors, ones actually control muscles,
upper motor neurons ones send specific signals. instance,
signals allow make cup coffee morning deliberately
engage kind behavior. Now, can probably make cup coffee
morning without think much. almost reflexive now,
means lot information perform particular movement
passed off circuitry now less brainstem
motor cortex. Now, giving detail? Well, want change motor


patterns, know circuitry changes possible
know changes likely occur. also need know,
signal brain nervous system change necessary? just pause
there, return initial question started with, is, brain control
behavior? answer yes, now know how. upper motor neurons,
lower motor neurons, got things called central pattern generators
connection muscle. go, just got, basically,
equivalent introduction college lecture motor control nervous
system. point today plasticity. can leveraged order
open magical thing call plasticity order access changes
emotional experience, belief system, ability remember use
specific kinds information say math, language, et cetera? Well, not
going tell

12:00 Exercise alone wonâ€™t change brain

need go running need go biking, simply going motor
patterns going open plasticity hate tell this, beneficial
exercise is, not open plasticity unless certain things. will tell
exactly certain things today. clear, think exercise wonderful
healthy, can improve cardiovascular function, maintain strength, bone density,
good stuff. just working exercise various kinds will not change
nervous system. will maintain it, can certainly improve health metrics,
not going open window plasticity. question need ask
can behavior change brain? already agree brain can change behavior,
can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided behavior
different enough specific ways behaviors already know
perform.

12:58 Behavior will change brain

Let repeat that. Can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided
behavior different enough sorts behaviors already know
perform. should've added word well. can't obviously perform


behavior don't know perform don't know yet.
key element accessing neuroplasticity frankly don't see
general discussion neuroplasticity.

13:30 Remembering wrong things

general discussion neuroplasticity learning, hear
gimmicks using different ways remember lots people's names arranging
things first letters mnemonics kind stuff, which, frankly,
feels really gimmicky. think look super learners, tend people
process say extreme memory. people extreme memory,
generally, literature shows us, pretty poor things. don't think us
interested walking around knowing remember everything. fact,
interesting studies looking humans over-remember, suffer
tremendously remember sorts things, like number top
receipt bodega bought Coca-Cola 10 years ago. useless
information people. don't well life, really. goal isn't
remember everything, goal selective brain changes.
talk brain changes, want highlight adaptive changes. whole
category things going discuss talk traumatic brain injury
dementia, topic future episode, things happen
damaged nervous system missing neurons. But, today, really want
talk something think near dear many hearts,
behaviors can engage access neuroplasticity

15:00 Behavior gate plasticity

can apply plasticity specific things want learn
unlearn. important don't want people get impression
really talking learning bunch motor movements. may athlete,
might not athlete. might want learn dance, might not.
might want learn dance get better remembering learning
languages, instance, unlearning difficult emotional experience, meaning
want remove emotional load particular memory experience.


talking today using behavior gate enter states mind body
allow access plasticity. talk different kinds plasticity
available us.

15:45 Types Plasticity

will point directly towards type protocols engage
change better, so-called adaptive plasticity. something
called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity just internal
representation outside world. map auditory space, believe
not, meaning neurons respond something right happens,
like [snaps fingers] snapping fingers right. can't snap well
left, whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak left
side. that, different neurons respond those. map
visual space. Certain neurons seeing things certain portions visual space
not others. map motor space, meaning move limbs
particular directions, know limbs even can't see them,
called proprioceptive feedback. knowledge
limbs are. fact, people lack certain neurons proprioceptive feedback,
poor controlling motor behavior. get injured lot. actually terrible
situation. got representations inside maps motor
commands. know that, instance, want reach grab pen front
me, need generate certain amount force. rarely overshoot, rarely miss
pen. maps motor world maps sensory world merged.
way create plasticity create mismatches errors perform things.
think amazing important feature neuroplasticity

17:32 Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

highly underappreciated. way create plasticity send signals
brain something wrong, something different, something isn't
achieved. think will completely reframe way people think
plasticity. us think plasticity as, "Okay, going get optimal
learning state flow, suddenly going able things


wish do." Well, hate break you, flow expression
already know do. not state learning. willing go bat
flo-wa-nis-tas want challenge one. Flow
expression nervous system capabilities already embedded us. Errors
making errors sync like nervous system
cued distinct biological mechanisms something isn't going right. And,
therefore, certain neurochemicals deployed signal neural circuits
change. talk experiments support just said. 'Cause
tell making errors route
shaping nervous system performs better better better. not
going tell last rep set hit failure gym anything like
neuroplasticity. hear pushing point cliff just
can't function anymore, signal. not signal. distinct
neuromuscular phenomenon bears zero resemblance takes get
neuroplasticity. talk errors making errors
triggers release chemicals allow us not just learn thing
motor sense, play piano, dance, et cetera, also creates
environment, milieu within brain, allows us go learn couple
uncouple particular emotion experience, better language learning, better
mathematical learning. really fundamental aspect built.
look it, actually straightforward. series logical steps
learn open hatches, becomes straightforward deploy. Last
episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking
question 20-year-old 15-year-old, "What can now really going
enhanced brain?" guess simple answer aside, get
broadest education can possible. means math, chemistry, physics,
literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures
passion excitement, put ton additional effort there.


recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving
space, not actually moving physical space, no
vestibular feedback. visual. stationary bike. unless
hanging off bike living room like almost point tipping bike,
not getting actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. mismatch
signal deploys dopamine, epinephrin, things. don't care
excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

1:24:15 Closing Remarks

12:00 Exercise alone wonâ€™t change brain

need go running need go biking, simply going motor

exercise is, not open plasticity unless certain things. will tell
exactly certain things today. clear, think exercise wonderful
healthy, can improve cardiovascular function, maintain strength, bone density,
good stuff. just working exercise various kinds will not change
nervous system. will maintain it, can certainly improve health metrics,
not going open window plasticity. question need ask
can behavior change brain? already agree brain can change behavior,
can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided behavior
different enough specific ways behaviors already know
perform.

12:58 Behavior will change brain

Let repeat that. Can behavior change brain? answer yes, provided
behavior different enough sorts behaviors already know
perform. should've added word well. can't obviously perform


behavior don't know perform don't know yet.
key element accessing neuroplasticity frankly don't see
general discussion neuroplasticity.

13:30 Remembering wrong things

general discussion neuroplasticity learning, hear
gimmicks using different ways remember lots people's names arranging
things first letters mnemonics kind stuff, which, frankly,
feels really gimmicky. think look super learners, tend people
process say extreme memory. people extreme memory,
generally, literature shows us, pretty poor things. don't think us
interested walking around knowing remember everything. fact,
interesting studies looking humans over-remember, suffer

dementia, topic future episode, things happen
damaged nervous system missing neurons. But, today, really want
talk something think near dear many hearts,
behaviors can engage access neuroplasticity

15:00 Behavior gate plasticity

can apply plasticity specific things want learn
unlearn. important don't want people get impression
really talking learning bunch motor movements. may athlete,
might not athlete. might want learn dance, might not.
might want learn dance get better remembering learning
languages, instance, unlearning difficult emotional experience, meaning
want remove emotional load particular memory experience.


talking today using behavior gate enter states mind body
allow access plasticity. talk different kinds plasticity
available us.

15:45 Types Plasticity

will point directly towards type protocols engage
change better, so-called adaptive plasticity. something
called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity just internal
representation outside world. map auditory space, believe
not, meaning neurons respond something right happens,
like [snaps fingers] snapping fingers right. can't snap well
left, whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak left
side. that, different neurons respond those. map
visual space. Certain neurons seeing things certain portions visual space
not others. map motor space, meaning move limbs
particular directions, know limbs even can't see them,
called proprioceptive feedback. knowledge
limbs are. fact, people lack certain neurons proprioceptive feedback,
poor controlling motor behavior. get injured lot. actually terrible
situation. got representations inside maps motor
commands. know that, instance, want reach grab pen front
me, need generate certain amount force. rarely overshoot, rarely miss
pen. maps motor world maps sensory world merged.
way create plasticity create mismatches errors perform things.
think amazing important feature neuroplasticity

17:32 Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

highly underappreciated. way create plasticity send signals
brain something wrong, something different, something isn't
achieved. think will completely reframe way people think
plasticity. us think plasticity as, "Okay, going get optimal
learning state flow, suddenly going able things


wish do." Well, hate break you, flow expression
already know do. not state learning. willing go bat
flo-wa-nis-tas want challenge one. Flow
expression nervous system capabilities already embedded us. Errors
making errors sync like nervous system
cued distinct biological mechanisms something isn't going right. And,
therefore, certain neurochemicals deployed signal neural circuits
change. talk experiments support just said. 'Cause
tell making errors route
shaping nervous system performs better better better. not
going tell last rep set hit failure gym anything like
neuroplasticity. hear pushing point cliff just
can't function anymore, signal. not signal. distinct
neuromuscular phenomenon bears zero resemblance takes get
neuroplasticity. talk errors making errors
triggers release chemicals allow us not just learn thing
motor sense, play piano, dance, et cetera, also creates
environment, milieu within brain, allows us go learn couple
uncouple particular emotion experience, better language learning, better
mathematical learning. really fundamental aspect built.
look it, actually straightforward. series logical steps
learn open hatches, becomes straightforward deploy. Last
episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking
question 20-year-old 15-year-old, "What can now really going
enhanced brain?" guess simple answer aside, get
broadest education can possible. means math, chemistry, physics,
literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures
passion excitement, put ton additional effort there.


recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.

high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,

behavior don't know perform don't know yet.
key element accessing neuroplasticity frankly don't see
general discussion neuroplasticity.

13:30 Remembering wrong things

general discussion neuroplasticity learning, hear
gimmicks using different ways remember lots people's names arranging
things first letters mnemonics kind stuff, which, frankly,
feels really gimmicky. think look super learners, tend people
process say extreme memory. people extreme memory,
generally, literature shows us, pretty poor things. don't think us
interested walking around knowing remember everything. fact,
interesting studies looking humans over-remember, suffer
tremendously remember sorts things, like number top
receipt bodega bought Coca-Cola 10 years ago. useless
information people. don't well life, really. goal isn't
remember everything, goal selective brain changes.
talk brain changes, want highlight adaptive changes. whole
category things going discuss talk traumatic brain injury
dementia, topic future episode, things happen
damaged nervous system missing neurons. But, today, really want
talk something think near dear many hearts,
behaviors can engage access neuroplasticity

15:00 Behavior gate plasticity

can apply plasticity specific things want learn
unlearn. important don't want people get impression
really talking learning bunch motor movements. may athlete,
might not athlete. might want learn dance, might not.
might want learn dance get better remembering learning
languages, instance, unlearning difficult emotional experience, meaning
want remove emotional load particular memory experience.


talking today using behavior gate enter states mind body
allow access plasticity. talk different kinds plasticity
available us.

15:45 Types Plasticity

will point directly towards type protocols engage
change better, so-called adaptive plasticity. something
called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity just internal
representation outside world. map auditory space, believe
not, meaning neurons respond something right happens,
like [snaps fingers] snapping fingers right. can't snap well
left, whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak left
side. that, different neurons respond those. map
visual space. Certain neurons seeing things certain portions visual space
not others. map motor space, meaning move limbs
particular directions, know limbs even can't see them,
called proprioceptive feedback. knowledge
limbs are. fact, people lack certain neurons proprioceptive feedback,
poor controlling motor behavior. get injured lot. actually terrible
situation. got representations inside maps motor
commands. know that, instance, want reach grab pen front
me, need generate certain amount force. rarely overshoot, rarely miss
pen. maps motor world maps sensory world merged.
way create plasticity create mismatches errors perform things.
think amazing important feature neuroplasticity

17:32 Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

highly underappreciated. way create plasticity send signals
brain something wrong, something different, something isn't
achieved. think will completely reframe way people think
plasticity. us think plasticity as, "Okay, going get optimal
learning state flow, suddenly going able things


wish do." Well, hate break you, flow expression
already know do. not state learning. willing go bat
flo-wa-nis-tas want challenge one. Flow
expression nervous system capabilities already embedded us. Errors
making errors sync like nervous system
cued distinct biological mechanisms something isn't going right. And,
therefore, certain neurochemicals deployed signal neural circuits
change. talk experiments support just said. 'Cause
tell making errors route
shaping nervous system performs better better better. not
going tell last rep set hit failure gym anything like
neuroplasticity. hear pushing point cliff just
can't function anymore, signal. not signal. distinct
neuromuscular phenomenon bears zero resemblance takes get
neuroplasticity. talk errors making errors
triggers release chemicals allow us not just learn thing
motor sense, play piano, dance, et cetera, also creates
environment, milieu within brain, allows us go learn couple
uncouple particular emotion experience, better language learning, better
mathematical learning. really fundamental aspect built.
look it, actually straightforward. series logical steps
learn open hatches, becomes straightforward deploy. Last
episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking
question 20-year-old 15-year-old, "What can now really going
enhanced brain?" guess simple answer aside, get
broadest education can possible. means math, chemistry, physics,
literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures
passion excitement, put ton additional effort there.


recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain

something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears

recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped

arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can

talking today using behavior gate enter states mind body
allow access plasticity. talk different kinds plasticity
available us.

15:45 Types Plasticity

will point directly towards type protocols engage
change better, so-called adaptive plasticity. something
called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity just internal
representation outside world. map auditory space, believe
not, meaning neurons respond something right happens,
like [snaps fingers] snapping fingers right. can't snap well
left, whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak left
side. that, different neurons respond those. map
visual space. Certain neurons seeing things certain portions visual space
not others. map motor space, meaning move limbs
particular directions, know limbs even can't see them,
called proprioceptive feedback. knowledge
limbs are. fact, people lack certain neurons proprioceptive feedback,
poor controlling motor behavior. get injured lot. actually terrible
situation. got representations inside maps motor
commands. know that, instance, want reach grab pen front
me, need generate certain amount force. rarely overshoot, rarely miss
pen. maps motor world maps sensory world merged.
way create plasticity create mismatches errors perform things.
think amazing important feature neuroplasticity

17:32 Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

highly underappreciated. way create plasticity send signals
brain something wrong, something different, something isn't
achieved. think will completely reframe way people think
plasticity. us think plasticity as, "Okay, going get optimal
learning state flow, suddenly going able things


wish do." Well, hate break you, flow expression
already know do. not state learning. willing go bat
flo-wa-nis-tas want challenge one. Flow
expression nervous system capabilities already embedded us. Errors
making errors sync like nervous system
cued distinct biological mechanisms something isn't going right. And,
therefore, certain neurochemicals deployed signal neural circuits
change. talk experiments support just said. 'Cause
tell making errors route
shaping nervous system performs better better better. not
going tell last rep set hit failure gym anything like
neuroplasticity. hear pushing point cliff just
can't function anymore, signal. not signal. distinct
neuromuscular phenomenon bears zero resemblance takes get
neuroplasticity. talk errors making errors
triggers release chemicals allow us not just learn thing
motor sense, play piano, dance, et cetera, also creates
environment, milieu within brain, allows us go learn couple
uncouple particular emotion experience, better language learning, better
mathematical learning. really fundamental aspect built.
look it, actually straightforward. series logical steps
learn open hatches, becomes straightforward deploy. Last
episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking

literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures

recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

episode, discussed basic principles neuroplasticity. didn't hear
episode, no problem, just review quickly, falsehood
everything experience changes brain. brain changes
certain neurochemicals, namely acetylcholine, epinephrin, dopamine, released
ways specific times allow neural circuits marked change.
change occurs later sleep. review later, but, basically,
need certain cocktail chemicals released brain order particular
behavior reshape way brain works. question really allows
neurochemicals released? last episode, talked focus.
haven't seen heard episode, might want check out, specific
tools practices can allow build capacity focus release
certain chemicals cocktail. But, today, going talk


chemicals cocktail, particular dopamine. really going center
discussion around issue making errors making errors actually
signal tells brain, "Okay, time change," or, generally, time pay
attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking
question 20-year-old 15-year-old, "What can now really going

literature, music, learn play instrument. saying 'cause wish had, et
cetera. Get broad training number things find thing really captures
passion excitement, put ton additional effort there.


recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put

something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,

kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative

pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called

reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one

attention things change. really want distinguish point really
clearly, going talk today lot motor vestibular, meaning
balance programs, not just learning motor commands balance, not just
learning new motor skills balance, also setting stage kind condition
brain can go learn things well.

21:30 Mechanisms Plasticity

talk classic experiments really nail important
discussion plasticity. mentioned last episode, just tell right now
again, brain incredibly plastic birth age 25. Passive
experience will shape brain just way chemicals
sloshing around way neurons arranged sorts
things. brain's job customize response experience.
somewhere 25, not like day 26th birthday, plasticity closes,
kind tapering off plasticity, need different mechanisms engage
plasticity adult. mostly going talking adult plasticity today,
got lot questions about, "Well, younger 25?" First all,
great. wish time machine, don't. said before, stinger
young, brain plastic,

22:30 learn young

less control experience. older, generally,
control experience, brain less plastic. already asking

recommend, including emotional development. Maybe topic future episode.
adult, young person, knowing tap plasticity
mechanisms powerful. need chemicals deployed nervous
system order mark whatever nerve cells happen firing time afterward
change. people obsessed asking, "What supplements, drugs,
conditions, machines will allow that?" natural set conditions
allow that. came world,

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward

reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no

course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe

23:50 Alignment brain maps: neuron sandwiches

learned take different maps experience, motor maps, auditory maps,
visual maps. link them, align maps. simplest example
one gave before. hear something off right, like click like that, come
fingers snapping come something generated somebody else
something else right, look right. hear left, look left.
hear right front me, keep looking right front me. hear behind me,
turn around. maps visual space maps auditory
space maps motor space aligned one another perfect register.
incredible feature nervous system. takes place structure called superior
colliculus, although don't need know name. Superior colliculus layers,
literally stacks neurons like sandwich zero point right front me,
maybe 10 15 degrees off right 10 15 degrees off left, aligned
auditory neurons, ones care sounds, 15 degrees right, sit
directly neurons look 15 degrees right visual system.
reach direction, signal sent layers
says 15 degrees off right direction look, direction listen,
direction move need move. alignment. really
powerful. allows us move space function lives
really fluid way. set development. important
experiments revealed maps plastic, meaning can shift,
subject neuroplasticity. specific rules allow us shift them.
key experiment. key experiment done colleague mine
now retired whose work absolutely fundamental field
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen. Knudsen Lab,



26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion

stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need

lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not

speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling

simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes

except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative

pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called

plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked

26:00 Wearing Prisms Face

many Knudsen Lab scientific offspring, showed one wear prism
glasses shift visual field, eventually there'll shift representation
auditory motor maps too. Now, initially looked young
subjects, moved visual world making wear prism
glasses. that, instance, pen front five degrees off center,
just little bit off center, listening this, like just little bit
right, prism glasses, actually see pen way far right.
actually here, see wearing prisms eyes.
happens first day so, ask people ask animal subjects whatever
reach object, reach wrong place seeing
isn't. gets especially complicated start including sounds.
thing off right making sound, thing actually right here.
hearing sound one location seeing object another location
wearing prisms. image world totally distorted. Or,
experiments done groups, wear glasses, subjects wore glasses
completely invert visual world everything upside down, extreme
example representational maps flipped shifted. find
young individuals, within day two, start adjusting motor behavior
exactly right way always reach correct location. hear
sound one location, see object make sound different
location, somehow able adjust motor behavior reach
correct location. incredible. absolutely incredible. Or, case people
look world upside down, somehow able navigate
upside world even though completely used feet floor
not ceiling people not walking us hanging off ceiling like bats.
Amazing. tells us maps aligned one another can
move shift rotate, even flip themselves. happens best young
individuals. older individuals, cases, takes long time
maps shift, cases never shift. experimental
scenario, important one understand really tamps fact
capacity create dramatic shifts representation outside


world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal

variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not

can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward

simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just

best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked

world. can get plasticity adults mimics plasticity get
juveniles? Well, Knudsen Lab labs looked this,
really interesting. First all, ask, signal plasticity? just
prism glasses on?

29:10 KEY Trigger Plasticity

No, experiment ruled out. just fact visual
thing appears far right fact right front me? No.
signal generates plasticity making errors. reaches failures
signal nervous system not working. And, therefore, shifts start
take place. fundamentally important think people think,
"Oh, well, practice going access beginner's mind," great
concept, actually, approaching things expecting make errors, great.
think believer beginner's mind. people understandably get frustrated, like
trying learn piece piano can't it, trying write
piece code, trying access sort motor behavior, can't
it, frustration drives crazy, [indistinct] "I can't it, can't it,"
don't realize [laughs] errors signaling brain nervous
system, "Something's not working." course brain doesn't understand
words something isn't working. brain doesn't even understand frustration
emotional state. brain understands neurochemicals released, namely
epinephrine acetylcholine, also, get this, molecule dopamine
start approximate correct behavior just little bit, start getting
little bit right. happens make errors, nervous system kind of,
don't want say freaks mechanistic controlled situation,
nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters neuromodulators say,
"We better change something circuitry." errors basis [laughs]
neuroplasticity learning. wish prominent there.
guess saying it. humans not like feeling frustration
making errors. exceedingly well whatever pursuits happen
involved in. ones don't, generally don't well. generally don't learn
much. think it, nervous system ever change?
ever change? Unless something afraid of, something made


us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes

minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high

something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance

early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,

variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon

like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.

neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes

except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One

arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,

us feel awful will signal nervous system needs change, error
performance. turns feedback errors, reaching
wrong location starts release number things. now heard
many times, epinephrin. increases alertness, acetylcholine, focus.
frustration leads us just kind quit walk away
endeavor absolute worst thing. acetylcholine released, creates
opportunity focus error margin, distance
like do. nervous system starts
make changes almost immediately order try get behavior right.
start getting even little bit right, third molecule comes online released,
dopamine, allows plastic changes occur fast.

32:20 Frustration Feeling Follow (Further Learning)

Now, happens naturally young brains. old brains, tends
pretty slow, except two conditions. let just pause just say this,
uncomfortable making errors get frustrated easily, leverage
frustration toward drilling deeper endeavor, setting
terrific set plasticity mechanisms engage. take frustration
walk away endeavor, essentially setting plasticity rewire
according happens afterwards, generally feeling pretty miserable.
now can kind start appreciate continuing drill process
point frustration

33:10 Incremental Learning

staying process little bit longer, define exactly mean
little bit, important thing adult learning well childhood learning,
adult learning particular. Now, Knudsen Lab two important sets
experiments. first one published "Nature,' important study,
showed juveniles can make massive shifts map representations,
meaning can shift visual world using visual prisms huge amount
quickly. Young individuals can shift representations world learn
reach correct location. get lot plasticity once, happens


fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving
space, not actually moving physical space, no
vestibular feedback. visual. stationary bike. unless
hanging off bike living room like almost point tipping bike,
not getting actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. mismatch
signal deploys dopamine, epinephrin, things. don't care
excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

fast period just couple days. adults, tends slow
individuals never actually accomplish full map shift. don't get plasticity.
talking map shifts, learning new language,
number different things [indistinct] attempting.
saying already said before, learn well youngsters,
not adults 25. started making increment
change smaller. instead shifting world huge amount putting prisms
shifted visual world way right, incrementally. So,
first, put prisms shifted just little bit, just like seven degrees believe
exact number. 14 degrees, 28 degrees.
found adult nervous system can tolerate smaller smaller errors
time, can stack errors can get lot plasticity. Put
simply, incremental learning adult absolutely essential. not going get
massive shifts representation outside world. make small
errors opposed big errors? Well, key smaller bouts focused learning
smaller bits information. mistake try learn lot information one
learning adult. papers Knudsen Lab show,
others gone show,

35:30 Huberman Free Throws

adult nervous system fully capable engaging huge amount
plasticity, need smaller increments per learning epoch per learning
episode. this? Well, say instance, terrible free throws,
say wanted learn free throws. 45 years old, well past 25
mark. going make errors. going make lot errors. go learning free
throws knowing errors gate plasticity, well, feel little bit better,
still aim rim basket net. Basically, showing little know
basketball. think know general themes around basketball, involves
net, back board, ball, course. go free throw line throw.
long go? Well, hitting point frustration. point,
continuing probably anywhere 10 100 trials limit, right?
limit want improve specific aspect motor behavior.
question paying attention to?


focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes

period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high

making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains

age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,

better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical

variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm

tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called

recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach

high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

1:24:15 Closing Remarks

focusing on? Well, obviously trying get ball basket. beauty
motor learning circuits auditory visual motor less teach
themselves. don't necessarily paying attention exactly contact
fingers ball random feature like whether not bending knees
not. key try number different parameters start approximate
behavior want get little bit better, trying get consistent that.
Now, many involved sports learning will say, "Okay, well, obvious, just
incremental learning." key thing errors. isolating errors
making number errors particular aspect motor movement, signals
brain plastic. leave episode going trying learn shoot
free throws, brain still plastic. Plasticity state brain nervous system.
not just geared toward specific thing trying learn. two aspects
plasticity think really need highlight. One plasticity geared
toward thing trying learn specifically. states
mind body allow us access plasticity. Now, toward end episode,
going spell specific protocols little detail. free throw example
might not correlate want learn. Actually, don't huge desire
learn free throws. less given basketball, free throws particular.
think important understand motor movements
straightforward way access states plasticity. can sake learning
motor movement sake accessing plasticity generally. One
important aspect getting plasticity adult not just smaller increments, meaning
shorter bouts. gave example another 100 free throws something, going
just getting 10,000 free throws packing much can
one episode not going efficient

38:50 Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

shorter bouts intense learning adult. error signals not
well-defined nervous system. not going know needs change.
really key element incremental learning, trying signal
nervous system least one component needs change. nervous system
needs know error is. Now, shoot free throws, Lord knows
lot different kinds errors happen, probably way bending knees,


arc ball, way organizing shoulders, probably eyes are, lots
things. ones focus on? said before, beauty motor
system don't worry that. just need get reps number
times, nervous system will figure far off motor commands are,
level maps described earlier, far deviate desired
behavior, getting ball basket, will start making adjustments.
make adjustments, nervous system makes adjustments me, key thing
not start adding variety new errors gets confused.
short learning bouts absolutely essential. say learning
instrument adult. Probably anywhere 7 minutes 30 minutes, provided
fully attending, focused, going pretty significant stimulus
inspire plasticity nervous system.

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors

meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked

centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage

carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking

mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped

what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without

vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors

new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

1:24:15 Closing Remarks

40:20 Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

Now, one way get lot plasticity adult. kind
Holy Grail thing getting massive plasticity young
person adult. Knudsen Lab revealed setting serious
contingency learning. situation subjects
find food displaced visual world, again, putting prisms,
find food, food made noise, noise set kind
location food array speakers. Basically, found
people adjust visual world order get food, plasticity
eventually occur, slow adult. very, slow. Unless
actually hunt food. order eat all, needed plasticity.
happened remarkable. observed plasticity adult can
dramatic, robust young person young animal subject, provided
serious incentive plasticity occur. absolutely important
understand, badly need want plasticity determines
fast plasticity will arrive, incredible brain just neurons
soup chemicals. means importance something, important
something us, actually gates rate plasticity magnitude plasticity.
just passively going things, going motions,
say, just getting reps quote, unquote, not sufficient get nervous


system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,
hitting limit need change not crucial enough. think
number places important relevance people battling
addiction, instance. will first say

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00

access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

system change. study, beautiful study, published journal neuroscience
shows actually accomplish something order eat order get
ration income, will reshape nervous system very, quickly.
nervous system capacity change tremendous rate, enormous degree
stage life provided important enough happen. think
might saying, "Well, duh, obvious. really crucial, then, course,
going change faster." didn't way. people
trying learn learn faster learn better, probably, cases,

43:25 Addiction

sympathize fact addictions biological component. clearly
cases people struggle tremendously change behavior nervous
system, cases, disrupted whatever substance abusing
behavior engaging in, much harder change.
also seen incredible examples people change
internal standpoint, belief desire change, massive change
possible. think studies Knudsen showing incremental
learning can create huge degree plasticity adult well
contingency high, meaning need eat, need make income,
need something vitally important us, plasticity can happen
enormous leaps just like can adolescence young adulthood. points
fact neurochemical system. underlying
mechanism. wasn't case sticking wire brain taking particular
drug. chemicals talk released drugstores,
will, [laughs] chemical stores already reside brains. key
tap stores. going next talk specific
behaviors liberate particular categories chemicals allow us make
incremental learning set stage plasticity similar enough
mimics high contingency states, like need get food, really create sense
internal urgency, chemical urgency, will. heard previous episodes


podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical

access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,

plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

podcast, may heard talk ultradian rhythm, 90-
minute rhythms

45:25 Example Ultradian-Incremental Learning

break 24-hour day. help break sleep different cycles
sleep like REM sleep non-REM sleep. break day ways allow us
learn best within 90-minute cycles, et cetera. might saying, "Wait,
talking ultradian cycles, moment ago talking 7-
minute 12-minute 30-minute learning cycles. Today, really talking
tap plasticity completion task working towards something
repetitively making errors. just frame context ultradian
cycle, might sit down, decide going learn conversational French,
mean probably don't already speak French. going sit down,
going decide going learn nouns verbs, might
practice set. ultradian cycle says first 5 10 minutes that,
mind going drift focus will probably kick in, provided
restricting visual world just material front you, something talked
last episode, somewhere around 10 15-minute mark. best
probably going get hour deliberate kind tunnel vision learning
there. mind will drift. toward end that, now hour
10 hour 20 minute cycle, brain will sort start flicker out, might
start thinking need eat fact use bathroom
something. 90 minutes, probably time just stop learning
go something else, maybe return second learning later, maybe take
nap afterwards something enhance learning. going happen within
90-minute block. going go cycle learning. refer
7 12 30 minutes making errors, mean really mode
repeating errors, not deliberately, trying best accomplish something,
failing. absolutely failing. trying remember say sign language
alphabet. trying teach recently, keep repeating
repeating, get certain point kept making errors, making errors,
making errors. want keep making errors period time saying will
last anywhere 7 30 minutes. exceedingly frustrating, frustration,


liberates chemical cues signal plasticity needs happen also
signal particular neurons active. case sign language, might
ones control hand movements well thinking
different letters are. signaling different opponents within networks
brain body, trying figure out, "Wait, errors coming from?
errors coming from? Ah, neurons, making mistakes.
making mistakes, making mistakes." essentially highlights
pathway change. case come back day two later
learning nap night two deep rest, find
can remember certain things motor pathways work. don't always get
perfectly, get lot right. Whereas, got wrong before. 7 30-
minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes

minute intense learning within ultradian cycle, want clear
that. people can tolerate many per day. people can
tolerate one two, maybe three. intense work. shooting free throws,
probably day. talking really trying accelerate plasticity
period 7 30 minutes per learning specifically
making errors. want really underscore that. not about, mentioned before,
coming little hack trick something sort. really trying
cue nervous system something needs change otherwise simply
won't change. Now, another aspect learning, think fair mention,
can learn easily

49:42 Bad Events

something bad happens us. don't wish anyone,
case something really terrible happens will lifetime memory
event. processes allow us uncouple emotional load event.
talked episodes back, episode dreams, trauma,
hallucinations. going return trauma release, PTSD,
themes future episode. reason negative experiences can wired
us quickly nervous system's main job keep us safe,
deeper level, negative experiences cue us fact whatever's
happening really bad different things tend happen
before. experience doesn't remap us, negative experiences deploy


high levels norepinephrine, high levels acetylcholine, really make
whatever experienced bad episode essentially queued up,
lookout it. number negative effects terms
psychological emotional effects, really process designed keep us safe.
ways can learn quickly besides just making errors
something really surprises us. positively surprised something
just flooded molecule dopamine, great opportunity plasticity.
Dopamine molecule almost always associated pleasure
accomplishment particular goal, really also molecule motivation.
molecule released inside us think right path.
capacity increase neuroplasticity, motivation, et cetera. released
response number natural behaviors, just help progression
species, things like food, sex, sense social connection, although
serotonin, serotonin doesn't effects plasticity quite
same. talk later.

51:55 Surprise!

dopamine think right path toward external goal,

52:00 Making Dopamine Work (Not Way Around)

little bit released tends give us motivation toward goal. think
everyone stand enhance rate learning following. Learn
attach dopamine, subjective way, process making errors.
really combining two modes plasticity ways together can accelerate
plasticity. So, earlier, talked making errors focus learning
includes making lot errors inside learning about. going
frustrating, frustration cue, epinephrine will high
conditions. can just subjectively associate experience
something good want continue path opposed quitting
hit point frustration, well now start create synergy
dopamine released subjectively think something good, tell
something good, situation making failures. words,


making failing repetitively, provided engaged specific set behaviors
it, well telling failures good learning
good us, creates outsize effect rate plasticity. accelerates plasticity.
Now, might asking, get asked lot,

53:20 release dopamine

"Well, get dopamine released? can just tell something
good bad?" Well, actually yes, believe not. thing dopamine
highly subjective. funny one person not necessarily funny next.
sense authenticity you. really want learning
thing trying learn, reason enough tell yourself, "Well,
frustrated, frustration source accelerated learning." Dopamine one
incredible molecules can released according things
hardwired us release dopamine. Again, things like food, sex, warmth
cold, cool environments warm. kind pleasure molecule overall.
also highly subjective releases dopamine one person versus next.
Everyone releases dopamine response basic kind behaviors
activities, dopamine also released according subjectively believe
good us. powerful it. fact, book highly
recommend, want read dopamine, book frankly wish
written, wonderful book, called "The Molecule More." really talks
dopamine not just molecule associated reward, molecule
associated motivation pursuit, just subjectively controlled dopamine
can be. make lots errors, tell errors important good
overall learning goals, learn attach dopamine, meaning release dopamine
brain start make errors,

55:00 (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

keep bouts learning relatively short adult. Younger people can
probably engage bouts learning. probably one reasons
learn much faster. can just pack much information brains
nervous systems compared adults. little bit like, use example


performance-enhancing drugs. drugs probably enhance performance
level increasing red blood cell count, et cetera. lot drugs
allow athletes recover faster can just train more. allow
work. child little bit like performance enhanced brain
milieu. brains kind natural, healthy neurochemicals afford lot
learning pursue it. goes back advice young people
early on. young, do? Learn much can many
things possibly can. suggest specializing something.

56:00 Timing Learning

guess not position give anyone direct advice, say, hopefully,
age 30, hopefully younger, sense excites try
get really good thing, provided serves world better. say
terms parenting advice. not place. maybe sometime episode
completely devoted sort youth learning youth. attaching
dopamine process making errors, start getting lots questions
really right questions, are, often this?
time? Well, talked little bit previous
episodes, long now kind nitty-gritty tools application,
us natural times throughout day going much
better tolerating errors much focused trying
do. Last episode focus, chances can't focus well 4:00
pm can 10:00 am. differs everybody depending sleeping
kind natural chemistry rhythms. find time times day
naturally highest mental acuity, really want engage
learning bouts. get point making errors
keep making errors 7 30 minutes. Just keep making errors drill
it. almost seeking frustration. can find pleasure
frustration, yes, state exists, created optimal neurochemical
milieu

57:36 (Chem)Trails Neuroplasticity



learning thing. beauty it, also created optimal
milieu learning things afterward. leave of, gave example
free throws, maybe playing tennis, maybe skill, sit
read book, brain heightened state learn retain
information. chemicals don't get released shut down.
creating whole milieu, environment chemicals. tale long
chemicals stay sloshing around brain many factors put
hard number it. going depend transporters enzymes sorts
things. least hour say, going state
heightened learning, ability learn, not just motor patterns cognitive
information, language information, maybe go therapy right work
something deliberate way trying work on, maybe don't go
therapy, maybe something else important you. Again, just
variety examples give. number things allow us powerfully
access states error kind surprising also kind fun. Again,
aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving
space, not actually moving physical space, no
vestibular feedback. visual. stationary bike. unless
hanging off bike living room like almost point tipping bike,
not getting actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. mismatch
signal deploys dopamine, epinephrin, things. don't care
excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density

many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped

what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without

jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving
space, not actually moving physical space, no
vestibular feedback. visual. stationary bike. unless
hanging off bike living room like almost point tipping bike,
not getting actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. mismatch
signal deploys dopamine, epinephrin, things. don't care
excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

1:24:15 Closing Remarks

ways adjust limbic friction. not just respiration. course, many
ways that. overall goal episode podcast

excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one

aren't gimmicks,

58:57 Three Key Levers Accelerate Plasticity

tap basic mechanisms plasticity. three like talk
next balance, meaning vestibular system, well two sides
call limbic friction autonomic arousal. none makes sense, going
put fine point one

59:15 Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm Focused

works opening neuroplasticity. talk limbic
friction. Now, limbic friction not term going find textbooks.
colleagues listening, want repeat limbic friction, realize not something
going find textbooks. important principle captures
lot information textbooks, neurobiology psychology,
really important implications. Limbic friction attempt give name
something nuanced mechanistic stress. Because, typically,
hear stress, think heart rate, heartbeat going fast, breathing fast,


sweating, not state want, alert want
calm. And, indeed, one condition limbic friction, meaning
limbic system taking control number different aspects autonomic
automatic biology. struggling control call top-down
mechanisms. trying calm order reduce level arousal.
familiar this, called stress response. However, another aspect
stress just important, tired fatigued need
engage, need alert are. call limbic friction
really designed describe fact autonomic nervous system isn't
want it, meaning trying alert trying less alert,
feel stressful people. way put word stress not
good word describe people experience stressful can either
tired alert. Now, bringing discussion
neuroplasticity? not discussion stress. point, will talk
stress tools deal stress. reason bringing
order access neuroplasticity, need components focus, need
component attaching subjective reward, need make errors, stuff.
lot people find difficult just get overall state access things.
now series gates people hard time accessing.
tired can't focus, instance. Well, beauty it. alert,
meaning anxious, want calm order learn better,
things can do. two spoken previously various
podcasts, just review really quickly, double inhale exhale.
inhaling twice nose exhaling mouth. not
yoga trick hack. called physiological sigh. offloads carbon
dioxide lungs, number different effects. described
textbooks dating back 30s number laboratories explored
neurocircuitry underlying so-called physiological sighs. will calm
faster anything else aware of. thing starting remove
tunnel vision. use tunnel vision, focused, epinephrine
released dilating field gaze, so-called panoramic vision. Great, now
can start sort move level autonomic arousal. key
want state arousal ideally matched thing trying
perform learn. really anxious can't even pick basketball feel


like shaking muscles tight, don't kind looseness,
move like that, almost makes look like throw free throw, miss 95%
time, unless basket very, low place directly. guess not
free throw, it? [laughs] case, point want state
alertness calm. need ways calm
amped up. side limbic friction important too. tired
can't focus, well, going impossible even get starting line,
speak, engaging neuroplasticity incremental learning, et cetera.
case, methods can wake up. best thing
get good night's sleep, not always possible, use NSDR,
non-sleep deep rest protocol. already done things simply
exhausted whatever reason, things often get asked
about, like sure cup coffee super oxygenation breathing, means inhaling
exhaling average breathing about. Now sort getting toward
realm like trick nervous system waking up.
bring oxygen making inhales deeper longer, will become
alert. start actually deploy norepinephrine breathe fast.
things can move so-called autonomic arousal arc.
want ask undergo learning

1:04:25 First Question Ask Learning

much limbic friction experiencing? alert want calmer,
calm sleepy want alert? going need
engage behaviors bring starting line order learn.
things can order learn better faster besides incremental
learning, center vestibular system. may come surprise
people, probably not surprise whose professions whose
recreation involves lot motor activity sort call high dimensional skill
activity,

1:05:00 Balance

not just running cycling linear activities like weightlifting, things involve


inversions lot lateral movement, actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,
kinds things, gymnastics type stuff. vestibular system access
neuroplasticity? Well, hardwired system balance, works
simple terms can possibly come with. move space, even
stationary, really three main planes movement. Now, realize
people just listening this, going folks just
listening watching video. three main modes
movement. turns brain doesn't really know body is,
except proprioceptive feedback. main way knows three
planes movement call pitch, like nodding. nod like this,
pitch. yaw, side side, like shaking head no.
roll side side like puppy looks you, like mm-mmm,
kind thing. pitch, yaw, roll. pilots will know exactly
talking about. brain knows orientation position body relative
gravity, depending whether not brain head actually engaging
pitch, yaw, roll, combination lean like like so,
combination pitch, yaw, roll. might say like, "What going here?" Well,
little things inner ear called semicircular canals. Just like
eyes two main functions, one see objects space set
circadian clocks subconscious mechanisms, ears two main roles. One
hear, perceive sound waves take sound waves perception, so-called
hearing, balance vestibular function. sitting ears
semicircular canals, little tubes little stones,
actually little bits calcium, roll back forth like little marbles. roll way,
roll way, pitch. go side side, sit flat
like go [makes swishing sound] like marbles inside hula hoop.
roll, kind 45 degrees kind
pitchy roll. Okay, great. sends signals rest brain body tell
us compensate shifts relative gravity. say, "Okay, thought
talking plasticity." gets really, really cool. Errors
vestibular motor sensory experience,

1:07:45 Cerebellum



meaning off-balance compensate looking at, thinking
about, responding world differently cause area brain called
cerebellum, actually means mini brain, looks like little mini brain like tucked
cortex back, cause cerebellum signal deeper brain
centers release dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine.
circuits inner ear, et cetera, cerebellum, designed
recalibrate motor movements relationship gravity changes. Something
fundamental survival. can't afford falling time missing things
grab for, running wrong direction something pursuing us.
hardwired circuits tap right chemical pathways. chemical
pathways gates plasticity. really want spell clearly 'cause
given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach


for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore

reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course

given lot information today. first thing is, arriving learning
about? need make sure level autonomic arousal correct. ideal state
going clear, calm, focused, maybe little bit arousal level, like
heightened arousal. understand limbic friction, understand can tired,
case going need get alert, can alert
going need get calmer. gets starting line.
starting line, going go learning about,
want start making errors. saying layer
interested using motor patterns way open plasticity
kinds learning, not just motor learning, disrupting vestibular motor relationship,
tell moment, can deploy release neurochemicals
brain place state makes much better learning makes
making errors much pleasureful, much willing that. Now,
probably saying, "Flow state, flow state." Okay, friends work flow
states

1:10:00 Flow States Not Path Learning

involved flow states trying figure are. great
respect people. want tip hat them. important work. But, again,
flow expression already know do. not learn,
express already learned. want really clear that.
kind presented super state highly desirable state can reach

describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded

communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,
handstands, road bike. is, unfortunately, what, don't want name
brands, stationary bikes give visual experience moving
space, not actually moving physical space, no
vestibular feedback. visual. stationary bike. unless
hanging off bike living room like almost point tipping bike,
not getting actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. mismatch
signal deploys dopamine, epinephrin, things. don't care
excited much fun ride much music playing love,
not situation

1:14:55 Arrive Learning

normal relationship gravitational pull. first gate
arrive learning appropriate level autonomic arousal. Clear focused
best, don't obsess right there, okay. little anxious little
bit tired, want make errors. talked that, vestibular motor
sensory relationship absolutely key want get heightened accelerated
plasticity. talked another feature, setting contingency.
reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
new relationships gravity windows plasticity enhanced. want
make sure underscore fact vestibular thing describing
way really accentuate plasticity. tapping inborn biological mechanism
cerebellum outputs deep brain nuclei associated dopamine,
acetylcholine, norepinephrine. don't want endanger course
pursuing activities, powerful mechanism.

1:19:25 Learning French Things Faster

kind amplifier plasticity, high contingency. really need learn
conversational French save relationship, chances going learn it.
limits, course, extent one can accentuate accelerate
plasticity. ceiling not infinite, although don't know high goes.
think reasonable say someone put gun head said, "Learn
conversational French next 120 seconds," conversational French will
limited probably just one word, probably word oui something like that.
can't stuff knowledge once. think dream brain-machine
interface, one will able download chip hippocampus cortex,
brain structure allow download conversational French.
someday may get that, capability may come about. Right now, not
exist, specific pill chemical will allow download
information quickly. issue around nootropics talked before.
things can increase focus, mainly things increase acetylcholine
transmission nicotine system, things can increase dopamine, things like
L-tyrosine. Again, not recommending these. need heed warnings
bottles, will increase neurochemicals. are, course, things
will increase epinephrin, things like caffeine, people, prescription,
take Adderall. I'm, again, not suggesting people take things. fact, today


focused almost exclusively behavioral tools ways structuring learning bouts
will allow access plasticity regardless age. center around
things sure look around see evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning powerful," or, "Oh, vestibular system can open opportunities
plasticity." sure yogis saying, "Wait, sounds exactly like
yoga. supposed push edge inversions sorts
things." Well, want clear, never said anyone inversions. said
vestibular system valuable portal neurochemical states
favor plasticity. not seldom, hear yoga community, will say
things like, "Much saying brain works neuroplasticity
already described embedded yoga practices." just want
clear, tremendous respect yoga community practices, done
yoga time time, find challenging valuable. not regular practitioner.

1:22:00 Yoga versus Science

problem yoga exactly problem science, yoga
lot practices specific names, no description
lending understanding mechanism. science lot mechanisms
[laughs] lot publications papers little, not no
description tools practices. goal not just today many ways throughout
course podcast bridge gaps various disciplines
ways grounded mainly fields neuroscience related fields. So,
yes, true look things mainly lens science, not say
exhaustively explains everything anything, say
lens one look something like neuroplasticity. just want
acknowledge great respect different practices communities.
think that, indeed, many cases different communities
practices aimed targeting goals outcomes. Science
neuroscience, understanding mechanism, can allow us gain kind
common understanding practices access things like
neuroplasticity, sleep, et cetera. believe. said previously podcast,
understanding mechanism affords us certain flexibility. don't mean physical
flexibility. mean flexibility can't engage particular behavior, maybe


injured maybe not right situation particular practice,
thinking mechanism, can adapt circumstances. talked
sleep. rigidly attached one protocol always looking sunlight one
particular time morning evening, not valuable
understanding mechanisms might look sunlight one particular time
versus another affords flexibility, allows adapt. life
dynamic don't control external conditions time.
understanding mechanism lens neuroscience, believe, can
powerful

1:24:15 Closing Remarks

because, course, multiple ways access dopamine, multiple
ways adjust limbic friction. not just respiration. course, many
ways that. overall goal episode podcast
give understanding mechanisms insights underlying

for. wrong [indistinct] reach already know things
describing, opinion. vestibular system, can engage
vestibular system create errors within vestibular motor operations
carrying out, create neurochemical state makes very,
good learning quickly regardless age. look like?
mean just inversions? mean yoga? Maybe. mean taking
corners faster road bike? say always swim freestyle breaststroke,
mean swimming backstroke butterfly? depends. depends, however,
very, easy understand parameter,

1:11:18 Novelty Instability Key

regularly perform particular motor behavior novel behavior is.
novel behavior terms relationship gravity, will
open opportunity plasticity. ever seen somebody just jumped
plane first time parachute? [laughs] don't even want think
what, just seen somebody jumped plane first time without
parachute, just hope plane ground. seen somebody that,
incredible state body brain flooded
neurochemicals novel them. However, got friends
communities done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens thousands
jumps, always alert aware, becomes pretty regular them.
point. not kind buzzed out, excited state afterwards
routine them. key bring novelty vestibular motor experience,
vestibular motor commands performing. that? Well,
orientation relative gravity. Now, wouldn't want anyone place
risk. can't handstands, don't try them, freestanding
whatever. good handstands, guess much plasticity
handstands half hour going create you. Zero. Zero. body fully
comfortable walking hands. see people walking hands,
upside down, inverted. Cirque du Soleil performers, comfortable
there, zero learning, zero plasticity failures errors
relationship gravity typical individual. Now, means
going use motor practices open plasticity learning, not just


practices, maybe cognitive skills things period follows,
need create sense novelty relative gravity. means either
new position slightly unstable. Believe not, don't want anyone injuring
themselves, sensation falling close falling signals cerebellum signal
deep brain centers release neurochemicals something
different need correct error very, fast. Now, earlier, talking
high contingencies learning, definitely don't want make kind
like either survive die kind experience. confess, occasionally look
parkour videos YouTube. Believe not, lot people died, ones
ridiculous things hanging off buildings things. not suggesting
that. Please don't that. talking finding safe ways explore
sensory motor vestibular space, call it, relationship things.
yoga. terrible yoga, opportunity
learn somebody skilled yoga, instance, gymnastics,

reason, important reason actually learn, even making failures,
learning will accelerated. really four things really need


plasticity adult. say also apply young people.

1:15:45 Reason Kids Learn Faster Adults

interesting kind thought experiment well, look
children, moving lot different dimensions. sometimes hanging
trees. sports always things tended get hurt lot, fall lot.
skateboarding younger, lot falling rolling various
things sort. whatever sport kids playing, even don't play
sport, tend move lot different relationships gravity, dimensionality
movements say, adults. one questions always kind
back mind is, age get less good engaging
neuroplasticity. Part brain ages certain changes
way neurons structured, molecular components, et cetera. kind
self-amplifying, say self-degenerating cycle get older, tend
get linear regular specific kinds movements. get
treadmill, take walk, just always go stairs, et cetera.
less opportunity, typically, engaging relationships gravitational
pull vestibular motor sensory convergence talked moment
ago. sort wonder whether not lack plasticity
reduced plasticity older individuals, includes me, reflect fact
chemicals aren't deployed not engaging certain behaviors
opposed can't engage behaviors chemicals aren't
deployed. Now, feeling both. reciprocal relationship.
certainly, again, don't think wise anyone doesn't muscle
stabilizing skills bone density, et cetera, start inversions things
sort. not talking here. interesting think sorts
exercise engage in. know getting heart rate elevated three five
times week really good us cardiovascular health. think ton data
support now. load-bearing exercise important increasing bone density
maintaining muscular strength proprioceptive feedback. Because, sure
many know this, resistance exercise actually trains nerve muscle
connections much muscles themselves. Something talked
beginning episode. think us stand increase degree


engage vestibular system novel ways. can done quite safely
number different mechanisms. not surfer, people sort
thing familiar orienting body differently according gravitational
pull. lying down, standing up, turning, leaning
head. So, again, pitch, yaw, roll thing. And, again, skilled
surfing, actually not going open plasticity just surfing. learning
