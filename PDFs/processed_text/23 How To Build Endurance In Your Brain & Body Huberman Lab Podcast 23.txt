last month four episodes exact, discussing physical performance
skill learning. talked learn skills faster, whether not
skills, athletic performance, dance, music, things sort. also talked
gain strength lose fat faster leveraging nervous system. Things
like shiver non-shiver, non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis. talked
neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss. talked
hypertrophy also called muscle growth covered everything sets reps
protocols, long stay cold ice bath? get out? keep shivering?
covered lot tools lot science. interested things
even perhaps want learn little bit make energy ATP
carbohydrates fats, covered previous four episodes. going
time moved new topic entirely, going one
episode series physical performance. simple reason asked
many questions something vitally important physical performance
long-term short-term health endurance. today going
talk endurance. Now, strength athlete not interested
endurance, don't depart just yet, turns ways train
endurance different previously imagined. think
long runs, long swims, marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks sort
thing puts sleep kind like Costello snoring background right now.
not long distance endurance athlete, sure. interested things
averse things, encourage continue listening
going talk little bit science specific protocols really
define endurance is? four types endurance ways train
concert things might like weight training skill training
yoga. endurance athlete, going cover lot tools


science certain will also help enhance training performance races
even just recreationally. topic endurance think badly misrepresented,
frankly, online. start digging science start talking real
experts area, discover, discovered that, incredibly
interesting area teaches us much body brain use
fuels can control fuels used body brain? today
will talk four kinds endurance. will also cover topic hydration
might sound incredibly boring. Like, okay, just drink water. really
interesting not hydration limiting factor performance,
right way hydrate, wrong way hydrate. actually formula
teach know much water drinking depending activity
levels. sounds like simple thing, like, oh, just tap off water urine
runs clear. actually wrong advice. turns don't hydrate properly,
can see 20 30% reductions performance, whether not strength, whether
increasing hypertrophy, whether not running, swimming, even mental
performance. even not athlete recreational athlete all, encourage
stay tuned part hydration. going cover usual little bit

often make announcements release protocols links protocols things
well. briefly want touch something previous episode
that, somebody trying increase muscle strength size,
simply somebody doesn't want increase muscle strength size,
just want maintain musculature have, vital perform
least five sets resistance training per muscle per week. don't that, lose
muscle time. one reason among many regular resistance
training protocol. Nobody wants start resembling folded envelope melted
candle. No one wants challenges getting chair off ground.
Maintaining musculature vital, not just immediate health, long-term
health trajectory. just want emphasize point. curious sets,
reps, close failure go not go? Whether not
cardiovascular training weight training? previous
episode right details, like think made simple understand.
strongly believe resistance training whether not body weight
bands weights simply lifting rocks yard logs yard vital
systemic physiology overall health, includes brain health.

00:12:56 Endurance: It’s Not Think, Crossover Brain Function

described reasons mechanisms previous episode.
Today, like talk endurance build endurance, use
endurance health entire body. Endurance, name suggests
ability engage continuous bouts exercise, continuous movement continuous


effort kind. believe ability engage activities call
endurance training physical endurance activities carry mental
performance things require long-term effort. touch end
reason believe biological crossover two things.
don't think simply case train strength speed athlete
short bouts exercise intense, can mental work
short bouts intense. clear cardiovascular exercise,
exercise getting heart rate continuously period time,
endurance exercise will define moment, vital tapping
enhancing various aspects biology body end brain brain
can perform work longer periods time, focused work, learning, et cetera. want
dive topic endurance want just begin addressing something
vital kind effort, whether mental effort physical effort.

00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones

always little bit science get right protocols. key thing
understand energy production body, meaning ability think,
ability talk, ability walk, ability run thing call ATP. ATP
mitochondria, just little call organelles within cells. little
factories make energy, will. ATP required anything requires energy,
anything requires effort. different ways get ATP.
gifted species ability convert lots things ATP.
can convert carbohydrates, literally kinds carbohydrates eat bagel, eat
piece pizza. Pizza usually dough, cheese things.
Costello hears talking pizza. Costello loves pizza, way. Eating piece
pizza, gets converted various things, fatty acids fats, glucose
bread, things get converted ATP within cells, things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis. talked previous episodes. muscles
neurons use different fuel sources generate ATP. ones used first
short bouts intense activity things like phosphocreatine. heard
creatine supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists muscles,
people take creatine. can load muscles creatine.
though, excuse me. Phosphocreatine great short, intense bouts effort.


really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical
signals head. not 90% mental, 10% physical. not 50/50. not 70/30,
100% nervous system. neurons. Okay? people say mental physical,
understand 100% neural. love the, much mental
much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate
electricity. go this. will probably entire lecture action
potential, basically order get nerve cells fire, contract muscle, say,
going continue. need sufficient sodium, salt, action potential
actual firing neurons driven sodium entering cell, rushing cell.
removal potassium. kind resetting levels
something called sodium potassium pump. sodium potassium pump
sodium action potentials, even don't know anything ATP
dependent. requires energy. need energy order get neurons fire.
pH dependent. depends conditions environment within brain
certain pH acidity. pH acid basic environment is?
will talk little bit pH simple terms can understand. nerves need salt,
need potassium. turns need magnesium need glucose
carbohydrates order power neurons, unless running ketones.
run ketones, make sure fully keto adapted. will talk
adding ketones top carbohydrate end episode. Okay,
nerves work. need carbohydrate, need sodium, potassium magnesium
order drive brain.

00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Key

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers
burning carbohydrate. converting ATP order generate
energy. Okay? pH important temperature important. episode
supercharge physical performance, talked using cooling
specifically palms bottoms feet cheeks face using
particular methods, can adjust temperature body muscle way
allows work, reps, run further, keep going
persist. temperature low high, ATP not going
available whole thing called pyruvate kinase pathway
temperature dependence pyruvate kinase. Check episode want learn
that. temperature important pH also important.

00:31:36 Using Blood, Heart, & Lungs Go Longer, Further, Intensity

got nerve, muscle, stuff blood available energy
source. blood, got glucose. literally blood sugar floating around.
say fasted three days, blood glucose going low.
not going great fuel source, will start liberate fats
adipose tissue fat. Fatty acids will start mobilize bloodstream
can burn energy. oxygen blood inhale, [inhales
deeply] bringing oxygen blood. fuel sources
neurons, muscle, blood, various tissues providing
opportunity induce effort whether not run swim writing talking. Now,
factors important heart going
move blood. heart can move blood oxygen, well, fuel
going available engage muscular effort thinking effort.
heart vitally important muscles ability work brain's ability
work. mentioned, oxygen times, obvious
lungs important. need bring oxygen in, distribute


tissues, oxygen critical conversion carbohydrates
conversion fats. get discussion whether not oxygen
important ketogenic metabolism, need oxygen there, need breathe
need breathe properly. just covered normally four
lectures energy consumption energy utilization. didn't go much detail all.
want imagine that, got different cell types. got
neurons, got muscle, need collaborate order generate effort
make decision something think hard run hard run far.
got fuel sources neurons, muscle, blood,
heart lungs going help distribute oxygen fuels. course
little energy pack call liver will allow pull little
carbohydrate need work. Okay? much want cover
energy consumption, lot. tells eat
use food fuel source, food can broken can
immediately burn glucose bloodstream, can rely
stored fuel liver, can rely stored fuel muscle, so-called glycogen.
lot different ways can generate ATP. ask
question, limiting performance? going allow us endure, engage
effort endure long bouts effort even moderately long bouts effort?
need ask things, nerve, muscle, blood, heart lungs limiting?
put differently, ask, neurons?
muscles? blood?
heart lungs going allow us
build endurance mental physical work able go longer,
intensity? real question? can work? way
energy, way get energy it, buy five things.
now going talk about, can actually build different types endurance?
level blood, heart, muscles
neurons. going skip back forth protocols, tools

00:37:15 4 Kinds Endurance

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal
Firing

make sure isn't strong eccentric load. now talk science
briefly works? Well, takes us back issue fuel utilization
fails? say, okay, say plank planking for,
know, maybe able plank minute two minutes three minutes.
point will fail. not going fail heart gives out. not
going fail can't get enough oxygen can breathe
that. going fail local muscular failure. means
do, choose protocol three five sets, et cetera, et cetera, build
muscular endurance, mainly going building going
building ability mitochondria use oxygen generate energy locally.


something called mitochondrial respiration. Respiration
involvement oxygen. also going increasing extent
neurons control muscles provide stimulus muscles contract.
independent power strength. Okay? even though low sets like three
five sets fact repetitions going failure, even
though seems resemble power strength hypertrophy type training,
distinctly different. not going generate strength, hypertrophy power. going
mainly create ability endure continually contract muscles repeatedly
contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension
muscle essentially concentric eccentric portion. remember want
eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available

difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen

minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary

themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort

able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit

total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race

incredible. like running mile on, resting running

Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature

Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn

frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength

Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually

three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen

used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,

pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,

gain strength lose fat faster leveraging nervous system. Things
like shiver non-shiver, non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis. talked
neurons can actually trigger accelerated fat loss. talked
hypertrophy also called muscle growth covered everything sets reps
protocols, long stay cold ice bath? get out? keep shivering?
covered lot tools lot science. interested things
even perhaps want learn little bit make energy ATP

time moved new topic entirely, going one
episode series physical performance. simple reason asked
many questions something vitally important physical performance
long-term short-term health endurance. today going
talk endurance. Now, strength athlete not interested
endurance, don't depart just yet, turns ways train
endurance different previously imagined. think
long runs, long swims, marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks sort
thing puts sleep kind like Costello snoring background right now.
not long distance endurance athlete, sure. interested things
averse things, encourage continue listening
going talk little bit science specific protocols really
define endurance is? four types endurance ways train

yoga. endurance athlete, going cover lot tools


science certain will also help enhance training performance races
even just recreationally. topic endurance think badly misrepresented,
frankly, online. start digging science start talking real
experts area, discover, discovered that, incredibly
interesting area teaches us much body brain use
fuels can control fuels used body brain? today
will talk four kinds endurance. will also cover topic hydration
might sound incredibly boring. Like, okay, just drink water. really
interesting not hydration limiting factor performance,
right way hydrate, wrong way hydrate. actually formula
teach know much water drinking depending activity
levels. sounds like simple thing, like, oh, just tap off water urine
runs clear. actually wrong advice. turns don't hydrate properly,
can see 20 30% reductions performance, whether not strength, whether
increasing hypertrophy, whether not running, swimming, even mental
performance. even not athlete recreational athlete all, encourage

often make announcements release protocols links protocols things
well. briefly want touch something previous episode
that, somebody trying increase muscle strength size,
simply somebody doesn't want increase muscle strength size,
just want maintain musculature have, vital perform
least five sets resistance training per muscle per week. don't that, lose
muscle time. one reason among many regular resistance
training protocol. Nobody wants start resembling folded envelope melted
candle. No one wants challenges getting chair off ground.
Maintaining musculature vital, not just immediate health, long-term
health trajectory. just want emphasize point. curious sets,
reps, close failure go not go? Whether not
cardiovascular training weight training? previous
episode right details, like think made simple understand.
strongly believe resistance training whether not body weight
bands weights simply lifting rocks yard logs yard vital
systemic physiology overall health, includes brain health.

00:12:56 Endurance: It’s Not Think, Crossover Brain Function

described reasons mechanisms previous episode.
Today, like talk endurance build endurance, use
endurance health entire body. Endurance, name suggests
ability engage continuous bouts exercise, continuous movement continuous


effort kind. believe ability engage activities call
endurance training physical endurance activities carry mental
performance things require long-term effort. touch end
reason believe biological crossover two things.
don't think simply case train strength speed athlete
short bouts exercise intense, can mental work
short bouts intense. clear cardiovascular exercise,
exercise getting heart rate continuously period time,
endurance exercise will define moment, vital tapping
enhancing various aspects biology body end brain brain
can perform work longer periods time, focused work, learning, et cetera. want
dive topic endurance want just begin addressing something
vital kind effort, whether mental effort physical effort.

00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones

always little bit science get right protocols. key thing
understand energy production body, meaning ability think,
ability talk, ability walk, ability run thing call ATP. ATP
mitochondria, just little call organelles within cells. little
factories make energy, will. ATP required anything requires energy,
anything requires effort. different ways get ATP.
gifted species ability convert lots things ATP.
can convert carbohydrates, literally kinds carbohydrates eat bagel, eat
piece pizza. Pizza usually dough, cheese things.
Costello hears talking pizza. Costello loves pizza, way. Eating piece
pizza, gets converted various things, fatty acids fats, glucose
bread, things get converted ATP within cells, things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis. talked previous episodes. muscles
neurons use different fuel sources generate ATP. ones used first
short bouts intense activity things like phosphocreatine. heard
creatine supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists muscles,
people take creatine. can load muscles creatine.
though, excuse me. Phosphocreatine great short, intense bouts effort.


really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical
signals head. not 90% mental, 10% physical. not 50/50. not 70/30,
100% nervous system. neurons. Okay? people say mental physical,
understand 100% neural. love the, much mental
much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate
electricity. go this. will probably entire lecture action
potential, basically order get nerve cells fire, contract muscle, say,
going continue. need sufficient sodium, salt, action potential
actual firing neurons driven sodium entering cell, rushing cell.
removal potassium. kind resetting levels
something called sodium potassium pump. sodium potassium pump
sodium action potentials, even don't know anything ATP
dependent. requires energy. need energy order get neurons fire.
pH dependent. depends conditions environment within brain
certain pH acidity. pH acid basic environment is?
will talk little bit pH simple terms can understand. nerves need salt,
need potassium. turns need magnesium need glucose
carbohydrates order power neurons, unless running ketones.
run ketones, make sure fully keto adapted. will talk
adding ketones top carbohydrate end episode. Okay,
nerves work. need carbohydrate, need sodium, potassium magnesium
order drive brain.

00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Key

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers
burning carbohydrate. converting ATP order generate
energy. Okay? pH important temperature important. episode
supercharge physical performance, talked using cooling
specifically palms bottoms feet cheeks face using
particular methods, can adjust temperature body muscle way
allows work, reps, run further, keep going
persist. temperature low high, ATP not going
available whole thing called pyruvate kinase pathway
temperature dependence pyruvate kinase. Check episode want learn
that. temperature important pH also important.

00:31:36 Using Blood, Heart, & Lungs Go Longer, Further, Intensity

got nerve, muscle, stuff blood available energy
source. blood, got glucose. literally blood sugar floating around.
say fasted three days, blood glucose going low.
not going great fuel source, will start liberate fats
adipose tissue fat. Fatty acids will start mobilize bloodstream
can burn energy. oxygen blood inhale, [inhales
deeply] bringing oxygen blood. fuel sources
neurons, muscle, blood, various tissues providing
opportunity induce effort whether not run swim writing talking. Now,
factors important heart going
move blood. heart can move blood oxygen, well, fuel
going available engage muscular effort thinking effort.
heart vitally important muscles ability work brain's ability
work. mentioned, oxygen times, obvious
lungs important. need bring oxygen in, distribute


tissues, oxygen critical conversion carbohydrates
conversion fats. get discussion whether not oxygen
important ketogenic metabolism, need oxygen there, need breathe
need breathe properly. just covered normally four
lectures energy consumption energy utilization. didn't go much detail all.
want imagine that, got different cell types. got
neurons, got muscle, need collaborate order generate effort
make decision something think hard run hard run far.
got fuel sources neurons, muscle, blood,
heart lungs going help distribute oxygen fuels. course
little energy pack call liver will allow pull little
carbohydrate need work. Okay? much want cover
energy consumption, lot. tells eat
use food fuel source, food can broken can
immediately burn glucose bloodstream, can rely
stored fuel liver, can rely stored fuel muscle, so-called glycogen.
lot different ways can generate ATP. ask
question, limiting performance? going allow us endure, engage
effort endure long bouts effort even moderately long bouts effort?
need ask things, nerve, muscle, blood, heart lungs limiting?
put differently, ask, neurons?
muscles? blood?
heart lungs going allow us
build endurance mental physical work able go longer,
intensity? real question? can work? way
energy, way get energy it, buy five things.
now going talk about, can actually build different types endurance?

00:37:15 4 Kinds Endurance

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing

simple way think is, go run, say first run

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use

remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key

key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go

people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

well. briefly want touch something previous episode
that, somebody trying increase muscle strength size,
simply somebody doesn't want increase muscle strength size,
just want maintain musculature have, vital perform
least five sets resistance training per muscle per week. don't that, lose
muscle time. one reason among many regular resistance
training protocol. Nobody wants start resembling folded envelope melted
candle. No one wants challenges getting chair off ground.
Maintaining musculature vital, not just immediate health, long-term
health trajectory. just want emphasize point. curious sets,

00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones

always little bit science get right protocols. key thing
understand energy production body, meaning ability think,
ability talk, ability walk, ability run thing call ATP. ATP
mitochondria, just little call organelles within cells. little
factories make energy, will. ATP required anything requires energy,
anything requires effort. different ways get ATP.
gifted species ability convert lots things ATP.
can convert carbohydrates, literally kinds carbohydrates eat bagel, eat
piece pizza. Pizza usually dough, cheese things.
Costello hears talking pizza. Costello loves pizza, way. Eating piece
pizza, gets converted various things, fatty acids fats, glucose
bread, things get converted ATP within cells, things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis. talked previous episodes. muscles
neurons use different fuel sources generate ATP. ones used first
short bouts intense activity things like phosphocreatine. heard
creatine supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists muscles,
people take creatine. can load muscles creatine.
though, excuse me. Phosphocreatine great short, intense bouts effort.


really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical
signals head. not 90% mental, 10% physical. not 50/50. not 70/30,
100% nervous system. neurons. Okay? people say mental physical,
understand 100% neural. love the, much mental
much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate
electricity. go this. will probably entire lecture action
potential, basically order get nerve cells fire, contract muscle, say,
going continue. need sufficient sodium, salt, action potential
actual firing neurons driven sodium entering cell, rushing cell.
removal potassium. kind resetting levels
something called sodium potassium pump. sodium potassium pump
sodium action potentials, even don't know anything ATP
dependent. requires energy. need energy order get neurons fire.
pH dependent. depends conditions environment within brain
certain pH acidity. pH acid basic environment is?
will talk little bit pH simple terms can understand. nerves need salt,
need potassium. turns need magnesium need glucose
carbohydrates order power neurons, unless running ketones.
run ketones, make sure fully keto adapted. will talk
adding ketones top carbohydrate end episode. Okay,
nerves work. need carbohydrate, need sodium, potassium magnesium
order drive brain.

00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Key

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers
burning carbohydrate. converting ATP order generate
energy. Okay? pH important temperature important. episode
supercharge physical performance, talked using cooling
specifically palms bottoms feet cheeks face using
particular methods, can adjust temperature body muscle way
allows work, reps, run further, keep going
persist. temperature low high, ATP not going
available whole thing called pyruvate kinase pathway
temperature dependence pyruvate kinase. Check episode want learn
that. temperature important pH also important.

00:31:36 Using Blood, Heart, & Lungs Go Longer, Further, Intensity

got nerve, muscle, stuff blood available energy
source. blood, got glucose. literally blood sugar floating around.
say fasted three days, blood glucose going low.
not going great fuel source, will start liberate fats
adipose tissue fat. Fatty acids will start mobilize bloodstream
can burn energy. oxygen blood inhale, [inhales
deeply] bringing oxygen blood. fuel sources
neurons, muscle, blood, various tissues providing
opportunity induce effort whether not run swim writing talking. Now,
factors important heart going
move blood. heart can move blood oxygen, well, fuel
going available engage muscular effort thinking effort.
heart vitally important muscles ability work brain's ability
work. mentioned, oxygen times, obvious
lungs important. need bring oxygen in, distribute


tissues, oxygen critical conversion carbohydrates
conversion fats. get discussion whether not oxygen
important ketogenic metabolism, need oxygen there, need breathe
need breathe properly. just covered normally four
lectures energy consumption energy utilization. didn't go much detail all.
want imagine that, got different cell types. got
neurons, got muscle, need collaborate order generate effort
make decision something think hard run hard run far.
got fuel sources neurons, muscle, blood,
heart lungs going help distribute oxygen fuels. course
little energy pack call liver will allow pull little
carbohydrate need work. Okay? much want cover
energy consumption, lot. tells eat
use food fuel source, food can broken can
immediately burn glucose bloodstream, can rely
stored fuel liver, can rely stored fuel muscle, so-called glycogen.
lot different ways can generate ATP. ask
question, limiting performance? going allow us endure, engage
effort endure long bouts effort even moderately long bouts effort?
need ask things, nerve, muscle, blood, heart lungs limiting?
put differently, ask, neurons?
muscles? blood?
heart lungs going allow us
build endurance mental physical work able go longer,
intensity? real question? can work? way
energy, way get energy it, buy five things.
now going talk about, can actually build different types endurance?
level blood, heart, muscles

kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal

make sure isn't strong eccentric load. now talk science
briefly works? Well, takes us back issue fuel utilization
fails? say, okay, say plank planking for,
know, maybe able plank minute two minutes three minutes.
point will fail. not going fail heart gives out. not
going fail can't get enough oxygen can breathe
that. going fail local muscular failure. means
do, choose protocol three five sets, et cetera, et cetera, build

building ability mitochondria use oxygen generate energy locally.


something called mitochondrial respiration. Respiration
involvement oxygen. also going increasing extent
neurons control muscles provide stimulus muscles contract.
independent power strength. Okay? even though low sets like three
five sets fact repetitions going failure, even
though seems resemble power strength hypertrophy type training,
distinctly different. not going generate strength, hypertrophy power. going
mainly create ability endure continually contract muscles repeatedly
contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension
muscle essentially concentric eccentric portion. remember want
eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit

repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles

don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active

know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen

eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier

appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking

realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

02:00:00 Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways Support, Sponsors, Sources

comes supplementation lot variety. magnesium malate
shown reduce soreness sometimes good. Cold hot contrast

00:11:28 Maintain Muscle

often make announcements release protocols links protocols things
well. briefly want touch something previous episode
that, somebody trying increase muscle strength size,
simply somebody doesn't want increase muscle strength size,
just want maintain musculature have, vital perform
least five sets resistance training per muscle per week. don't that, lose
muscle time. one reason among many regular resistance
training protocol. Nobody wants start resembling folded envelope melted
candle. No one wants challenges getting chair off ground.
Maintaining musculature vital, not just immediate health, long-term
health trajectory. just want emphasize point. curious sets,
reps, close failure go not go? Whether not
cardiovascular training weight training? previous
episode right details, like think made simple understand.
strongly believe resistance training whether not body weight
bands weights simply lifting rocks yard logs yard vital
systemic physiology overall health, includes brain health.

00:12:56 Endurance: It’s Not Think, Crossover Brain Function

described reasons mechanisms previous episode.
Today, like talk endurance build endurance, use
endurance health entire body. Endurance, name suggests
ability engage continuous bouts exercise, continuous movement continuous


effort kind. believe ability engage activities call
endurance training physical endurance activities carry mental
performance things require long-term effort. touch end
reason believe biological crossover two things.
don't think simply case train strength speed athlete
short bouts exercise intense, can mental work
short bouts intense. clear cardiovascular exercise,
exercise getting heart rate continuously period time,
endurance exercise will define moment, vital tapping
enhancing various aspects biology body end brain brain
can perform work longer periods time, focused work, learning, et cetera. want
dive topic endurance want just begin addressing something
vital kind effort, whether mental effort physical effort.

00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones

always little bit science get right protocols. key thing
understand energy production body, meaning ability think,
ability talk, ability walk, ability run thing call ATP. ATP
mitochondria, just little call organelles within cells. little
factories make energy, will. ATP required anything requires energy,
anything requires effort. different ways get ATP.
gifted species ability convert lots things ATP.
can convert carbohydrates, literally kinds carbohydrates eat bagel, eat
piece pizza. Pizza usually dough, cheese things.
Costello hears talking pizza. Costello loves pizza, way. Eating piece
pizza, gets converted various things, fatty acids fats, glucose
bread, things get converted ATP within cells, things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis. talked previous episodes. muscles
neurons use different fuel sources generate ATP. ones used first
short bouts intense activity things like phosphocreatine. heard
creatine supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists muscles,
people take creatine. can load muscles creatine.
though, excuse me. Phosphocreatine great short, intense bouts effort.


really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical
signals head. not 90% mental, 10% physical. not 50/50. not 70/30,
100% nervous system. neurons. Okay? people say mental physical,
understand 100% neural. love the, much mental
much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate
electricity. go this. will probably entire lecture action
potential, basically order get nerve cells fire, contract muscle, say,
going continue. need sufficient sodium, salt, action potential
actual firing neurons driven sodium entering cell, rushing cell.
removal potassium. kind resetting levels
something called sodium potassium pump. sodium potassium pump
sodium action potentials, even don't know anything ATP
dependent. requires energy. need energy order get neurons fire.
pH dependent. depends conditions environment within brain
certain pH acidity. pH acid basic environment is?
will talk little bit pH simple terms can understand. nerves need salt,
need potassium. turns need magnesium need glucose
carbohydrates order power neurons, unless running ketones.
run ketones, make sure fully keto adapted. will talk
adding ketones top carbohydrate end episode. Okay,
nerves work. need carbohydrate, need sodium, potassium magnesium
order drive brain.

00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Key

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.

people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles

deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker

minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary

themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.

neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not
allowed pacer, visual pacer allow access systems
brain body allow create energy, effort. find

governing bodies races said, okay, sure, pacer someone
front, can draft off them, actually kind aerodynamic effect
someone front makes easier run wake airstream.
speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

Steve Prefontaine. clear mostly battle himself,
also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going
win. going max effort least perceive max effort. Someone passes
them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional
gear? deeper resource? often express talk it, kind
psychological terms like heart willpower something kind got transplanted

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

02:00:00 Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways Support, Sponsors, Sources

comes supplementation lot variety. magnesium malate
shown reduce soreness sometimes good. Cold hot contrast
therapy soreness things sort. general, focused mainly today
behavioral tools. notice tools accessible without need lots
equipment. didn't say need rower, need kettlebell though will
work. hope able illustrate endurance isn't just one thing.
not just ability go long bouts exercise different kinds, also
mental component way neurons work. also
different forms endurance muscular endurance, going fail
'cause muscles muscle energy utilization nerves innovate
muscles locally not failure bring oxygen blood. Whereas long

depending big lawn is. use job kid mowing lawns
tell you, didn't many neighbors big lawns,
felt huge 'cause really convoluted. pushing mower,
old fashioned mowers not electric mowers, work. also

00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones

always little bit science get right protocols. key thing
understand energy production body, meaning ability think,
ability talk, ability walk, ability run thing call ATP. ATP
mitochondria, just little call organelles within cells. little
factories make energy, will. ATP required anything requires energy,
anything requires effort. different ways get ATP.
gifted species ability convert lots things ATP.
can convert carbohydrates, literally kinds carbohydrates eat bagel, eat
piece pizza. Pizza usually dough, cheese things.
Costello hears talking pizza. Costello loves pizza, way. Eating piece
pizza, gets converted various things, fatty acids fats, glucose
bread, things get converted ATP within cells, things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis. talked previous episodes. muscles
neurons use different fuel sources generate ATP. ones used first
short bouts intense activity things like phosphocreatine. heard
creatine supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists muscles,
people take creatine. can load muscles creatine.
though, excuse me. Phosphocreatine great short, intense bouts effort.


really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric

typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort

able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional

running effort human, know, heart.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

02:00:00 Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways Support, Sponsors, Sources

comes supplementation lot variety. magnesium malate
shown reduce soreness sometimes good. Cold hot contrast
therapy soreness things sort. general, focused mainly today
behavioral tools. notice tools accessible without need lots
equipment. didn't say need rower, need kettlebell though will
work. hope able illustrate endurance isn't just one thing.
not just ability go long bouts exercise different kinds, also
mental component way neurons work. also
different forms endurance muscular endurance, going fail
'cause muscles muscle energy utilization nerves innovate
muscles locally not failure bring oxygen blood. Whereas long
duration effort. going about, know, VO2 max,
ability efficient long bouts 12 minutes exercise. One set,
say 12 minutes maybe several hours. just mention long duration

depending big lawn is. use job kid mowing lawns
tell you, didn't many neighbors big lawns,
felt huge 'cause really convoluted. pushing mower,
old fashioned mowers not electric mowers, work. also

really pushing hard something physical, say see car
side road car stalled person says, "Hey, can help push
car?" start push. going phosphocreatine going
main fuel source. start tap things like glucose literally just
carbohydrate sugar blood. keep pushing car,
keep engaging particular effort, keep studying keep listening
podcast, start tap fuel sources like glycogen liver,
just, like little pack, just like might packed sandwich something
work. little pack glycogen liver can rely on.
fat stored adipose tissue. Even very, low body fat percentage like
one people like 3% 5% body fat really thin skin, little body fat,
can extract lipids fatty acids body fat. like storage pack, storage
pack energy can converted ATP. without going detail,
say today energy say ATP, just remember regardless diet,
regardless nutritional plan, body capacity use creatine, glucose,
glycogen, lipids. ketogenic, ketones. talk ketosis.

00:18:00 Vital Need Oxygen: Why?

order generate fuel, energy. Now, crucial point that, order
complete process taking fuels converting energy,
time need oxygen. need air basically system. Now, not actual air.
need oxygen molecules system, comes mouth
nose, goes lungs distributes via bloodstream. Oxygen not fuel,
like fire no oxygen can't actually burn logs, blow lot
oxygen onto fire, basically, onto logs flame there, basically will take fire,
will burn. Okay? Oxygen allows burn fuel. today going ask
critical questions. allows us perform? allows us continue effort long
periods time? effort run,

00:19:00 Allows Us Endure (Anything)?

swim, studying, anything extends long
period time. Well, going need energy going need oxygen.


way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk
specific training protocols can follow carry bodily
systems running swimming, et cetera, way brain works. talk
endurance asking first, limiting factors endurance? stops
us? addressing answering that,

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms

going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody

endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing

endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think

eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.

protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour

burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,

drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

02:00:00 Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways Support, Sponsors, Sources

way answer question like allows us endure, right? Endurance.
allows us keep going? Well, think things like willpower. willpower?
Willpower neurons. neurons brain. thing called central
governor decides whether not continue whether not
stop, whether not quit. Okay? whether not somebody
lot call resilience endurance, whether not
somebody taps early quits early can't handle frustration,
fuel utilization specific neurons. ask question,
limiting factor performance? Right? instead saying, allows us
endure? say, prevents us enduring? prevents us
moving forward? factors say, know what? No more, not going
continue run. know what? really long, hard day maybe
easy day feeling lazy, just don't even really feel like getting
moving. going talk today actually gets right heart
motivation fuel use. Motivation fuel allocation. going talk

00:20:46 5 Things Allow Us Persist/Endure & Causes Quitting

will understand allows us get effort continue effort. five
main categories things allow us engage effort. neurons, nerves,
muscle, muscle, blood, things blood, heart lungs. Now, don't want
completely write off things like immune system systems body,
nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs five want focus today,
data are. go forward this, want acknowledge Dr.
Andy Galpin, last episode, tremendously helpful
informative terms exercise physiology. true expert. laboratory,
full professor work muscle biopsy, understands science,
also works athletes works recreational athletes, professional athletes
really understands variety levels systems work? person
consulted today's episode, although access literature well.


going mention key review you, afficionados, really want get
weeds. encourage you, want detail check Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page, think also Twitter. definitely Instagram.
content excellent, really understands... learned really believe
intellectual somebody understands topic multiple levels specificity
detail can communicate that. Andy true intellectual muscle physiology
performance. hear word intellectual kind back
cringe that, understand also practitioner. thank you, Andrew Galpin.
Andy Galpin support episodes hope guest
podcast soon. nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs.

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin

like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort

able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

front, can draft off them, actually kind aerodynamic effect
someone front makes easier run wake airstream.
speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going

them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional
gear? deeper resource? often express talk it, kind
psychological terms like heart willpower something kind got transplanted

running effort human, know, heart.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

02:00:00 Synthesis; Next Episodes, Zero-Cost Ways Support, Sponsors, Sources

comes supplementation lot variety. magnesium malate
shown reduce soreness sometimes good. Cold hot contrast

work. hope able illustrate endurance isn't just one thing.
not just ability go long bouts exercise different kinds, also

depending big lawn is. use job kid mowing lawns
tell you, didn't many neighbors big lawns,
felt huge 'cause really convoluted. pushing mower,
old fashioned mowers not electric mowers, work. also

00:22:50 Quit: Mind

talk neurons work. Okay? want tell
experiment going make clear quitting mental thing not physical
thing. quit? Well, experiment done couple years ago
published journal Cell. Cell Press journal, excellent journal showing
class neurons brain stem, back brain shut off, quit.
Now, neurons release epinephrin. Epinephrin adrenaline. anytime
engaged effort kind, releasing epinephrin. Anytime awake really,
releasing epinephrin brain. fact, little roup neurons back
brain called locus coeruleus like. churning epinephrin
time, something stresses us out, churns acts kind
alertness signal whole brain. also course adrenaline epinephrin
released body makes body ready things. think epinephrin
readiness signal. engaged effort, readiness signal
churned brain. relax falling asleep, epinephrin levels
low. Okay, really interesting experiment subjects engage
bouts effort trying move forward toward goal. manipulated visual
environment stripes, kind like fences passing sides them.
that, trick subjects thinking effort either allowing
move forward, right? rungs fence moving past,
effort futile no longer moving forward make
runs move slowly even though subjects making lot effort move


forward. Okay? analogous similar treadmill trying
walk treadmill just can't move conveyor, right? virtual
reality putting ton effort, seems like moving excruciatingly
slow. experience recently real life. swim Pacific,
trying go south swimming caught current, not cup
pulls ocean. kept looking left, saw hotel
shoreline, swimming swimming swimming swimming,
20 minutes later looked left hotel still exactly before,
meant wasn't moving. felt futile. Eventually, either current changed
something changed eventually swam past hotel, got back beach
eventually drove home. essentially experiment.
found neurons release epinephrin, another cell type called glia,
actually means glue Latin, paying attention much epinephrin
released. point system reaches threshold. reaches
threshold shuts off release epinephrin. like quit, it, no
effort signal. extend time glia said, ah, enough.
release adrenaline system, subjects keep going.
desire continue put differently, willingness continue desire quit
mediated events two ears. Now, doesn't mean body's not
involved, means neurons critically important. two categories
neurons important. ones head tell us get go take
run. ones allow us encourage us continue run,
neurons shut things off say no more. course neurons
connect muscles control muscles. reason quit rarely
body quits, mind quits. Now, never want encourage people
drive point injury, not going good anybody,
good know neural. ability persist neural.

00:27:19 “90% Mental” Myth

people say it, hear that, know, sports effort fighting, 90%
mental, 10% physical. whole discussion much mental, much
physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical
signals head. not 90% mental, 10% physical. not 50/50. not 70/30,
100% nervous system. neurons. Okay? people say mental physical,
understand 100% neural. love the, much mental
much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate
electricity. go this. will probably entire lecture action
potential, basically order get nerve cells fire, contract muscle, say,
going continue. need sufficient sodium, salt, action potential
actual firing neurons driven sodium entering cell, rushing cell.
removal potassium. kind resetting levels
something called sodium potassium pump. sodium potassium pump
sodium action potentials, even don't know anything ATP
dependent. requires energy. need energy order get neurons fire.
pH dependent. depends conditions environment within brain
certain pH acidity. pH acid basic environment is?
will talk little bit pH simple terms can understand. nerves need salt,
need potassium. turns need magnesium need glucose
carbohydrates order power neurons, unless running ketones.
run ketones, make sure fully keto adapted. will talk
adding ketones top carbohydrate end episode. Okay,
nerves work. need carbohydrate, need sodium, potassium magnesium
order drive brain.

00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Key

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers
burning carbohydrate. converting ATP order generate
energy. Okay? pH important temperature important. episode
supercharge physical performance, talked using cooling
specifically palms bottoms feet cheeks face using
particular methods, can adjust temperature body muscle way
allows work, reps, run further, keep going
persist. temperature low high, ATP not going
available whole thing called pyruvate kinase pathway
temperature dependence pyruvate kinase. Check episode want learn
that. temperature important pH also important.

00:31:36 Using Blood, Heart, & Lungs Go Longer, Further, Intensity

got nerve, muscle, stuff blood available energy
source. blood, got glucose. literally blood sugar floating around.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements

deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available

difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even

things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

physical? absolutely silly. just proves no knowledge underlying
biology behind statement. neither mental physical. Everything physical,


everything neurons. thinking responsibility chemicals electrical

much physical just disappear.

00:28:10 Critical Need Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)

argument means nothing not actionable. Now, nerves need
order continue fire? need order get neurons say, will persist.
Well, need glucose. Unless keto ketogenic adapted, need
carbohydrate glucose. neurons run on. need electrolytes.
Neurons called sodium potassium pump blah, blah, blah. generate

Muscle. Muscle going engage generating energy first using


phosphocreatine system. High bouts effort really intense effort, short-lived seconds
minutes, probably like seconds going phosphate creating literally
fuel source muscle going burn, just like logs fire.
glycogen stored carbohydrate muscle, also can burned just like
logs fire generate energy. let make crystal clear. move
wrist towards shoulder contract bicep really hard, muscle fibers
burning carbohydrate. converting ATP order generate

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles

deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker

minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going

Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.

aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift

think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate

parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit

00:37:15 4 Kinds Endurance

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal

make sure isn't strong eccentric load. now talk science
briefly works? Well, takes us back issue fuel utilization
fails? say, okay, say plank planking for,
know, maybe able plank minute two minutes three minutes.
point will fail. not going fail heart gives out. not
going fail can't get enough oxygen can breathe
that. going fail local muscular failure. means
do, choose protocol three five sets, et cetera, et cetera, build
muscular endurance, mainly going building going
building ability mitochondria use oxygen generate energy locally.


something called mitochondrial respiration. Respiration
involvement oxygen. also going increasing extent
neurons control muscles provide stimulus muscles contract.
independent power strength. Okay? even though low sets like three
five sets fact repetitions going failure, even
though seems resemble power strength hypertrophy type training,
distinctly different. not going generate strength, hypertrophy power. going
mainly create ability endure continually contract muscles repeatedly
contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension
muscle essentially concentric eccentric portion. remember want
eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going

repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race

incredible. like running mile on, resting running

ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood

talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,

okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training

breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big

just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore

functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty

many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal

going fail can't get enough oxygen can breathe
that. going fail local muscular failure. means
do, choose protocol three five sets, et cetera, et cetera, build
muscular endurance, mainly going building going
building ability mitochondria use oxygen generate energy locally.


something called mitochondrial respiration. Respiration
involvement oxygen. also going increasing extent
neurons control muscles provide stimulus muscles contract.
independent power strength. Okay? even though low sets like three
five sets fact repetitions going failure, even
though seems resemble power strength hypertrophy type training,
distinctly different. not going generate strength, hypertrophy power. going
mainly create ability endure continually contract muscles repeatedly
contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension
muscle essentially concentric eccentric portion. remember want
eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit

going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens

repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running

that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume

say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver

relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

00:37:15 4 Kinds Endurance

primary resource content episode. talk four
kinds endurance achieve those? believe everybody
sort endurance practice, regular endurance practice. clear vital
functioning body mind. clear longevity benefits.
lot reasons true, main one good energy
utilization musculature blood, vascular system
oxygenating system, lungs, so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system
musculature. body brain function much better. many papers
now, much data support that. believe everyone either try maintain
muscle have, provided already gone puberty
development. engaged regular endurance exercise. Now,


many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing

kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles

deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker

minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary

themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort

able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going

used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &

et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

many people, think endurance exercise. means what? hour long run got
get StairMaster treadmill hours end week. turns
not case. four kinds endurance, can train specifically
one those, can vary training. talk four kinds
endurance. interesting different protocols
use order build maximize them.

00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience

now understand fuel sources use order build thing call
endurance. first all, muscular endurance. Muscular endurance
ability muscles perform work time, failure continue able
perform work going due muscular fatigue, not cardiovascular fatigue.
not breathing hard can't get enough blood muscles
quit mentally, muscles give out. Okay? One
good example be, pick stone yard stone
not extremely heavy you, needed anywhere 50 100
times, picking putting picking putting
picking putting down. point, muscles will fatigue.
will fail endure. Muscular endurance incredibly useful variety physical
pursuits. will talk mental pursuits supports well. terms
physical pursuits, ability given muscle perform repeated work going
improve golf swing. going improve tennis swing. going improve
posture, ability dance, ability repeatedly engage activity
requires effort way different kind endurance will build
simply increasing cardiovascular fitness, ability generate kind easy
repetition. talk muscular endurance is? Muscular endurance
going something can perform anywhere 12 25, even
100 repetitions. actually like train muscular endurance.
give specific protocol moments. good example push-ups,
right? get floor start push-ups, even somebody
knees push-ups, push-ups, eventually
won't able push-ups not going couldn't
get enough oxygen system, heart wasn't pumping enough blood.


going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide
posture abdominal muscles helpful posture upright
upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural
muscles. can also done with, mentioned, kettlebell swings lower
back legs posterior chain. number different exercises
with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles
repeatedly, right? hard... sure there, kind hard
imagine. can isometrics, can standard non-
isometric type movements,

00:48:40 Make Muscles Resilient: Mitochondrial Respiration, Neuronal
Firing

make sure isn't strong eccentric load. now talk science
briefly works? Well, takes us back issue fuel utilization
fails? say, okay, say plank planking for,
know, maybe able plank minute two minutes three minutes.
point will fail. not going fail heart gives out. not
going fail can't get enough oxygen can breathe
that. going fail local muscular failure. means
do, choose protocol three five sets, et cetera, et cetera, build
muscular endurance, mainly going building going
building ability mitochondria use oxygen generate energy locally.


something called mitochondrial respiration. Respiration
involvement oxygen. also going increasing extent
neurons control muscles provide stimulus muscles contract.
independent power strength. Okay? even though low sets like three
five sets fact repetitions going failure, even
though seems resemble power strength hypertrophy type training,
distinctly different. not going generate strength, hypertrophy power. going
mainly create ability endure continually contract muscles repeatedly
contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension
muscle essentially concentric eccentric portion. remember want
eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits

exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably

significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something

going muscles fail. why. want able
push-ups even pull-ups. Muscular endurance really about.
actually no coincidence lot military bootcamp style training not done
weights, done things like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups running.
really building muscular endurance. ability perform work repeatedly
time given set muscles neurons. good protocol build muscular
endurance.

00:41:50 Protocol Building Muscular Endurance. No Major Eccentric Component

just give now explain underlying science follows.
really good muscular endurance training protocol according scientific
literature be, three five sets anywhere 12 100 repetitions.
huge range. Now, 12 25 repetitions going reasonable people.
rest periods going anywhere 30 180 seconds rest.
anywhere half minute three minutes rest. might five sets push-
ups, done getting maximum push-ups although people might zero
knees down. people might 10 push-ups,
people might 25, go way 100. Rest anywhere 30
180 seconds, next set total three five sets. doesn't
actually sound like ton work. thing something like plank.
plank position actually way build muscular endurance, not strength. Okay?
sure used develop strength, really muscular endurance.
three five sets planks. planks probably even
not repetitions, isometric hold say, kind static hold
wall sit another example. probably minute two
minutes, take rest anywhere 30, 60, 180 seconds, repeat.
things like pushing sled, push-ups, isometric planks, even pull-ups, will work.
others forms training, want this, approach failure
actually fail unable perform another repetition mark
end set. one critical feature building muscular endurance no
major east centric loading component. Now, haven't talked much eccentric
concentric loading. concentric loading shortening muscle
typically lifting weight. east centric movements lengthening


muscle typically lowering weight. pull get chin
bar chin up, concentric portion effort, lower
yourself, eccentric portion. Eccentric portion resistance training kind,
whether not endurance strength one major causes soreness.
people will susceptible this, excuse others, create
damage muscle fibers. Muscular endurance building muscular endurance
not include movements include major eccentric loads. going
push-ups, doesn't mean want drop, know, smash chest
floor. way chest touch ground every push-up.
real push-up. Okay? not breaking 90 elbows, pushing
chest touch floor straightening out. proper push-up.
pull-up pull chin bar. Neither include
slow eccentric lowering component. using train muscular
endurance three five sets 12 25 maybe even 100 repetitions
3,280 seconds rest between. means jumping also going
poor tool building muscular endurance, jumping slowing
component land. things like plyometrics agility work moving
side side, decelerating, slowing lot, not going
good muscular endurance. Terrific cardiovascular training conditioning
kinds skill training agility that. want build muscular
endurance, want make muscles able work longer. going
three five sets 12 100 reps, 30 180 seconds mainly concentric
movement. Okay? Not slow lowering phase heavy lowering phase. might
kettlebell swings things sort. Isometrics, mentioned, things like planks
wall sets will work. Now, interesting that, doesn't seem
like people normally think endurance. yet shown nice, quality
peer-reviewed studies, several cited review mentioned earlier,
muscular endurance can improve ability engage long bouts call long
duration, low-intensity endurance work. can support long runs. can support
long swims. can build also... can build postural strength endurance
simultaneously mainly accomplished isometrical. things like planks
actually quite good building endurance spinal erector muscles provide

upper neck muscles things sort. days everyone seems texts


neck. Everyone basically staring toes time default towards
toes. isometric holds can good building muscular endurance. can
spot people including yourself, perhaps poor muscular endurance postural
muscles anytime stop moving, lean wall hip
will move one side, always leaned one side. guilty too.
actually pointed out. like think concern often rubbing
lower back. indeed asymmetries postural muscles
probably genetic probably just excessive work
something sort right shoulder set lower left things
sort. wanted improve those, improve really focusing
symmetry isometric. Symmetry meaning holding hands equivalent positions
planks isometric holds building muscular endurance postural

with, compound exercises mainly. rare people
kind muscular endurance work specifically things like bicep curls triceps.
aren't many activities really rely isolation muscles

contract muscles. Okay? Continually using isometric holds, repeatedly, excuse
me, using repetition type exercise contraction extension

eccentric portion light relatively fast, not fast injure yourself,
certainly not deliberately slowed down. recommended, say Andy
Galpin not use Olympic lifts this, get past eight 12
25 repetitions, especially form Olympic lifts key not getting injured.
people can perform sorts lifts likes snatches deadlifts
cleans jerks overhead presses, probably not great idea goal push
body points fatigue, open injury, unless
skilled that, really good coach can help guide
lifts. one form endurance muscular endurance.
mainly going rely neural energy. nerves muscle.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit

seconds off, extreme 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens
need dribble ball field, instance shoot goal.


playing tennis, long rally. sudden, somebody really starts,
know, putting back heels really make maximum amount
effort run net get ball across that. Things sort. Okay?
variety places carry type training,
support endurance. muscle endurance. muscles ability
generate lot force short-term, repeatedly. Okay? way
conceptualize this. different maximum power. Even though feels like
maximum effort, not building power speed muscles.
distinctly different protocols. key elements bringing

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic

Starting off course, fewer sets getting training

repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature

Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal

frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments

However, clear now understand intuitively kind

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2

system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,

degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,

active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements

deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available

difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits

exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

One thing can can actually increase speed. also true

that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight

significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not

YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually

M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three

beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts

arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?

part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual

performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen

efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit
fatigue, exhausted, breathing really hard systems
body linked component well, kind motivational
component. third fourth sixth set of, know, 20 seconds hundred
seconds off, extreme 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens
need dribble ball field, instance shoot goal.


playing tennis, long rally. sudden, somebody really starts,
know, putting back heels really make maximum amount

variety places carry type training,
support endurance. muscle endurance. muscles ability
generate lot force short-term, repeatedly. Okay? way
conceptualize this. different maximum power. Even though feels like
maximum effort, not building power speed muscles.
distinctly different protocols. key elements bringing

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic

anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training

repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature

positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift

However, clear now understand intuitively kind

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

governing bodies races said, okay, sure, pacer someone
front, can draft off them, actually kind aerodynamic effect
someone front makes easier run wake airstream.
speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

01:53:10 Physiological Basis “Extra Gear”, Accessing “Kick”, Steve
Prefontaine

Steve Prefontaine. clear mostly battle himself,
also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going
win. going max effort least perceive max effort. Someone passes
them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional
gear? deeper resource? often express talk it, kind
psychological terms like heart willpower something kind got transplanted
us descended us. not remove spiritual aspects sport
running effort human, know, heart.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

00:51:31 Long Duration Endurance: 12minutes More, One “Set”, Efficiency
Movement

not going rely quite much available blood, heart
lungs. now talk extreme endurance long duration
endurance. type people typically think think
endurance. talking long run, long swim, long bike ride. Well, long
anywhere 12 minutes several hours maybe even entire day, maybe
eight nine hours hiking running biking. people actually
kinds really long events marathons, instance. anything longer 12 minutes.
type work builds fuel utilization muscles, builds activity
neurons brain involved call central pattern generators.


talked previous episode several previous episodes. groups
neurons allow body engage regular rhythmic effort without
think movement much. running stepping swimming
already know swim, peddling bike walking upstairs hiking,
not thinking right, left, right, left. carried central pattern generators.
going less hundred percent maximum oxygen uptake,
VO2 max, talk VO2 max is. just want give sense
protocol is, underlying science. many sets? One. Long duration effort
one set 12 minutes longer. not counting repetitions. sure hope
going 30 minute run even 15 minute run, not counting
steps, not counting pedal strokes, not rower counting poles
rower. suppose could, think pretty dreadful. Seems like
poor utilization cognitive brain space. getting regular repeated effort
ability continue effort going dependent mainly efficiency
movement ability strike balance movement itself,
generation muscular movements required, fuel utilization across
different sources nerve muscle, blood, heart lungs. ask question.
fail long run? quit? Well, set long run,
assuming glycogen liver muscles, going use
energy first, even low intensity. guess not talking sprinting,
talking heading door starting off marathon. starting
assuming conditioning even don't, going burn
carbohydrate. going burn glucose bloodstream, going burn
carbohydrate muscles contract. call slow twitch muscles.
contracting, start burning fuel make ATP continue contract.
mind going use less energy depending much willpower, much
fight get order generate effort. really want
underscore this. somebody thinking, maybe go run, maybe don't
go run. two o'clock. Okay, 2:05. No, want go half hour
maybe main hour. going that. Guess what?
burning useful energy use either run, example,
something else. think something hard, ruminate,
perseverate idea decision, burning neural energy neural
energy glucose epinephrin things talked before. willpower


part ability devote resources things part making decisions
just either not it. not just mindset. think right time
place train. also think not good. words, utilizes excessive
resources churn decisions excessively, probably burn much cognitive
energy deciding whether not given training not actual
training. Okay? talk long duration effort can relate mental
performance, long duration effort one set, 12 minutes longer.
go 30 minutes 60 minutes hour. talk programming later
episode. going less hundred percent maximum oxygen
uptake. heart rate not going ceiling maxed out.
efficiency movement. building. go run
30 minutes, building capacity repeat performance. next
time, efficient actually burning less fuel. might seem little bit
counterintuitive, every time run, building
mitochondrial density. not much mitochondrial oxidation respiration.
building mitochondrial density. actually increasing amount ATP
can create given effort. becoming efficient. Okay?
burning less fuel overall thing. really long slow
distance long bouts effort really about.

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration

lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits

exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably

significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit
fatigue, exhausted, breathing really hard systems
body linked component well, kind motivational
component. third fourth sixth set of, know, 20 seconds hundred
seconds off, extreme 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens
need dribble ball field, instance shoot goal.


playing tennis, long rally. sudden, somebody really starts,
know, putting back heels really make maximum amount
effort run net get ball across that. Things sort. Okay?
variety places carry type training,
support endurance. muscle endurance. muscles ability
generate lot force short-term, repeatedly. Okay? way
conceptualize this. different maximum power. Even though feels like
maximum effort, not building power speed muscles.
distinctly different protocols. key elements bringing
breathing oxygen utilization way max. not quite hitting failure,
really pushing system point not ready another
set yet begin another set. not necessarily psychologically ready. talk
adaptations causes terms stroke volume

deliver blood oxygen lungs tissues. going get specific
breathe different types protocols happening
level heart?

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic
conditioning. HIIT two forms, anaerobic aerobic. just heard
anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training
extending sets one parameter expand. ratio
three one. 30 seconds 10 seconds off, one five, 20 seconds 100
seconds off, powerful tool building aerobic conditioning one-to-one
ratio. one-to-one ratio powerful building average. energy systems
involving, remember nerve muscle blood, heart lungs. one-to-one
ratio might run mile. however long takes, say takes six
minutes seven minutes, rest equivalent amount time.
repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles
26 miles. Well, not discouraging people ever long duration endurance.
think important. builds many energy
utilization systems. really teaches engage, excuse me, nerve muscle
firing. improves ATP mitochondrial function muscle. allows blood deliver
oxygen muscle brain. explain is. allows
heart deliver oxygen overall. builds tremendous lung capacity.
will talk exactly breathe build lung capacity. sake
warming performance. look like?
this? Well, really question workouts asking much work can one
eight 12 minutes, right? rest, repeat. much work can
eight 12 minutes rest repeat? many times
this? Well, sort thing pretty intense. probably
want two, maybe three times week not many things.
will talk program can moved forms training. just
give little hint now. clear described review article
referred will link another article well. concurrent training,
strength training endurance training four kinds describing
today can done. can program week. want get four
ideally six even better 24 hours workouts. hard,
instance, one-to-one mile repeats like run mile rest equivalent time, run
mile rest equivalent time two three times week, also weight

Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,

talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going

effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,

pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely

lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly

00:57:00 Everyone Train Long Duration Endurance: Capillaries Muscle &
Brain

Now, long duration effort? want it? good
you? Well, something important builds capillary beds
within muscles. talk little bit vasculature. haven't done much
yet, seen episode supercharging performance. talked
AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis blood moves arteries directly
veins, unusual, takes place so-called glabrous skin
palms, face bottoms feet. Typically, areas
body happens is, arteries bring blood given tissue like muscle, veins
return blood back heart. exceptions, general.
arteries veins little tiny called capillary beds microcapillaries.
tiny little avenues, like little tiny streams estuaries bigger


arteries veins. Now, actually contained within muscle. amazing
can increase number them. can literally build new capillaries.
can create new little streams within muscles type long duration effort
talking 12 minutes steady effort useful
that, useful increasing mitochondria, energy producing elements
cells, actual muscle cells. reason blood arrives muscles
oxygen. muscles going use oxygen.
deoxygenated blood going sent back heart lungs. Now,
capillaries build muscles, oxygen available
muscles. don't want get much physics fluid flow. basically
difference taking hose sticking dirt just directly like
turning faucet given rate, spigot rather, bunch little hoses
like sprinkler system go irrigate whole yard. irrigation equivalent
capillary bed system. good using energy sources within blood.
simple way think is, go run, say first run
done while, 12 15 minutes somewhere right around
20 minutes like, it. just can't continue. Well, come back next
time run, built endurance largely built capillary
beds. expanded little streams blood can deliver oxygen
muscles. going feel relatively straightforward either go little bit quicker
duration, distance. extend run another five 10
minutes. long duration work, unlike muscular endurance like planks
everything talking really building capillary
systems mitochondria, energy utilization systems within muscles
themselves. important understand. distinctly different say
building neurons fire muscles. neurons already there, going
fire muscles just fine. fact, life depended it, today
probably run marathon. probably get injured, psychologically
physically painful. don't recommend unless trained it.
train properly it, long duration bouts effort
twice week three times week pretty soon become easy,
building vascular micro beds microvascular beds called. Okay?
able bring energy muscles able utilize energy.



01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit
fatigue, exhausted, breathing really hard systems
body linked component well, kind motivational
component. third fourth sixth set of, know, 20 seconds hundred
seconds off, extreme 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens
need dribble ball field, instance shoot goal.


playing tennis, long rally. sudden, somebody really starts,
know, putting back heels really make maximum amount
effort run net get ball across that. Things sort. Okay?
variety places carry type training,
support endurance. muscle endurance. muscles ability
generate lot force short-term, repeatedly. Okay? way
conceptualize this. different maximum power. Even though feels like
maximum effort, not building power speed muscles.
distinctly different protocols. key elements bringing
breathing oxygen utilization way max. not quite hitting failure,
really pushing system point not ready another
set yet begin another set. not necessarily psychologically ready. talk
adaptations causes terms stroke volume

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic
conditioning. HIIT two forms, anaerobic aerobic. just heard
anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training
extending sets one parameter expand. ratio
three one. 30 seconds 10 seconds off, one five, 20 seconds 100
seconds off, powerful tool building aerobic conditioning one-to-one
ratio. one-to-one ratio powerful building average. energy systems
involving, remember nerve muscle blood, heart lungs. one-to-one
ratio might run mile. however long takes, say takes six
minutes seven minutes, rest equivalent amount time.
repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles
26 miles. Well, not discouraging people ever long duration endurance.

heart deliver oxygen overall. builds tremendous lung capacity.
will talk exactly breathe build lung capacity. sake
warming performance. look like?
this? Well, really question workouts asking much work can one
eight 12 minutes, right? rest, repeat. much work can
eight 12 minutes rest repeat? many times
this? Well, sort thing pretty intense. probably
want two, maybe three times week not many things.
will talk program can moved forms training. just
give little hint now. clear described review article
referred will link another article well. concurrent training,
strength training endurance training four kinds describing
today can done. can program week. want get four
ideally six even better 24 hours workouts. hard,
instance, one-to-one mile repeats like run mile rest equivalent time, run
mile rest equivalent time two three times week, also weight
training long run afterwards. quickly lead break
people, unless very, good energy utilization systems. really
kind advanced elite athlete, dare say using tools enhance
performance level blood hormones. actually going talk

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift

mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long

apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow

nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just

Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity

inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending

kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually

three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen

mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long

used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift

Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate

parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead

that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way

key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give

01:01:00 Two Distinct Types High-Intensity Interval Training: Anaerobic & Aerobic

long duration. got muscular endurance got long duration
endurance. two kinds recent years gotten
lot attention excitement, people not distinguishing
two kinds endurance. shame failing distinguish
two kinds call high-intensity training, sometimes called high intensity interval
training. people, perhaps you, not getting nearly much physical mental
benefit high intensity training could. want talk two kinds
high-intensity interval training, brain body,
sorts adaptations cause? that, can really start build
specific energy systems brain body ways best serve
cognitive work. sorts things like strength speed hypertrophy
running marathons matter. two kinds high intensity training
endurance. Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. One, anaerobic, so-
called aerobic endurance, no oxygen. aerobic endurance.

01:02:20 Anaerobic HIIT: 3-12 Sets, Work:Rest Ratio 3:1 1:3; Quality Repetitions
Key

qualify HIIT, high intensity interval training. talk anaerobic
endurance first. Anaerobic endurance protocol perspective going three
12 sets. Okay? records talk repetitions are, going
performed whatever speed allows complete work good, safe form.
Okay? fast, slow work continues, repetitions may
slow down, may speed up. Chances going slow down.
work? sets look like? Remember long slow distance one set. Muscular
endurance three five sets. High-intensity anaerobic endurance going
somewhere three 12 sets. going ratio work rest
anywhere three one one five. Okay? three one ratio set
look like? Well, going 30 seconds hard pedaling bike, instance,
running rower. just examples. pool, swimming.
number things air squats, weighted squats will provided
can manage that. 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off. brief rest. three


one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long

apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,

air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air

Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending

kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also

collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe

can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential

offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way

Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical

eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier

appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental

functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

one just good example 30 seconds 10 seconds off. opposite
extreme ratio one five. 20 seconds hundred seconds off.
work 20 seconds rest hundred seconds. Now, difference?
three one ratio? 30 seconds 10 seconds off,
one five, 20 seconds 100 seconds off? Well, will depend whether not
quality movement important you. just take look three
one ratio. three one ratio, going 30 seconds hard peddling
bike followed 10 seconds. maybe one call assault bikes,
stop 10 seconds repeat, chances will able
one, two, three, four, maybe even many 12 sets, really good condition
able pedaling bike doesn't require ton
skill. incorrectly, elbow flares little bit something,
unlikely get injured unless really extreme. Okay? movement
done instance, kettlebells. 30 seconds 10 seconds off. first set will
probably good form. second one will pretty good form, say
getting fifth sixth set going 30 seconds 10 seconds off chances
quality repetitions will degrade significantly. increase
probability going get injured, going damage way,
can't complete movement smaller muscles like grip
muscles might give out. Okay? quality repetitions going drop considerably
three one approach. just effort. talk
builds system moment, fine. people, quality form
important, maybe using weights, maybe squats. going
20 seconds 100 seconds rest. Maybe even barbell loaded squat,
maybe kettlebells, maybe got resistance
allowing this. find longer rest, even though 20
seconds intense effort, followed longer rest hundred seconds will allow
perform quality repetitions safely time. building
anaerobic endurance look like? tell actually good for, true
practical sense. anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
decide first week, might two three times week, maybe
even just week, depending things doing, talk
programming end. generate just three sets. might three
sets 20 seconds hard effort, followed 100 seconds rest. repeat 20


seconds hard effort, 100 seconds rest, 20 seconds effort, 100 seconds rest,
might twice week. week adding one two sets,
okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point
workout. fatigue will trigger adaptation. ask adaptation
triggering. Well, triggering mitochondrial respiration, ability
mitochondria generate energy using oxygen bringing
so... maxing out, literally getting VO2 max. hitting
threshold much oxygen can use system? One adaptations will
mitochondria will shift can use oxygen.
going also increase capillary beds, not much going able
increase amount neuron engagement muscle. normally start hit
fatigue, exhausted, breathing really hard systems
body linked component well, kind motivational
component. third fourth sixth set of, know, 20 seconds hundred
seconds off, extreme 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
going component want stop. pushing repeating
another set safely, course. training neurons able
access energy, literally, convert ATP muscles therefore
access energy ATP. adaptation mitochondria's ability use
oxygen, tremendous carry effects types exercise.
know appreciate people using high intensity interval training kind
similar order just like burn fat, know, workouts, quote unquote.
useful building capacity engage short bouts effort repeatedly really lock
in. don't want use word focus not strictly mental focus, able
generate short bouts intense work can beneficial competitive sports
team sports sprinting component, field opens
need dribble ball field, instance shoot goal.


playing tennis, long rally. sudden, somebody really starts,
know, putting back heels really make maximum amount
effort run net get ball across that. Things sort. Okay?
variety places carry type training,
support endurance. muscle endurance. muscles ability
generate lot force short-term, repeatedly. Okay? way
conceptualize this. different maximum power. Even though feels like
maximum effort, not building power speed muscles.
distinctly different protocols. key elements bringing
breathing oxygen utilization way max. not quite hitting failure,
really pushing system point not ready another
set yet begin another set. not necessarily psychologically ready. talk
adaptations causes terms stroke volume
minutes talk work sort can increase heart's ability
deliver blood oxygen lungs tissues. going get specific
breathe different types protocols happening
level heart?

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic
conditioning. HIIT two forms, anaerobic aerobic. just heard
anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training
extending sets one parameter expand. ratio
three one. 30 seconds 10 seconds off, one five, 20 seconds 100
seconds off, powerful tool building aerobic conditioning one-to-one
ratio. one-to-one ratio powerful building average. energy systems
involving, remember nerve muscle blood, heart lungs. one-to-one
ratio might run mile. however long takes, say takes six
minutes seven minutes, rest equivalent amount time.
repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles
26 miles. Well, not discouraging people ever long duration endurance.
think important. builds many energy
utilization systems. really teaches engage, excuse me, nerve muscle
firing. improves ATP mitochondrial function muscle. allows blood deliver
oxygen muscle brain. explain is. allows
heart deliver oxygen overall. builds tremendous lung capacity.
will talk exactly breathe build lung capacity. sake
warming performance. look like?
this? Well, really question workouts asking much work can one
eight 12 minutes, right? rest, repeat. much work can
eight 12 minutes rest repeat? many times
this? Well, sort thing pretty intense. probably
want two, maybe three times week not many things.
will talk program can moved forms training. just
give little hint now. clear described review article
referred will link another article well. concurrent training,
strength training endurance training four kinds describing
today can done. can program week. want get four
ideally six even better 24 hours workouts. hard,
instance, one-to-one mile repeats like run mile rest equivalent time, run
mile rest equivalent time two three times week, also weight
training long run afterwards. quickly lead break
people, unless very, good energy utilization systems. really
kind advanced elite athlete, dare say using tools enhance
performance level blood hormones. actually going talk
end work? four kinds endurance. Muscular
endurance. long-duration endurance. high intensity interval training


two kinds, anaerobic aerobic. last type, aerobic one works best.

01:15:20 Building Stronger Heart & Better Brain: Eccentric Loading Heart: Stroke
Volume

seems kind one-to-one ratio. use
actually doing? talk heart lungs oxygen,
something can benefit understanding. will become
clear discussion type training useful even non-athletes
order improve oxygenation energy utilization brain heart. brain
heart probably two important systems need take care
life. Yes, musculature needs maintained. want build it,
you. try maintain musculature, maintaining
enhancing brain function cardiovascular function. absolutely clear key
health longevity short long-term. sorts training talked
today shown useful enhancing
strength mind. Yes, talk that. well health brain
body. talk sorts adaptations happening brain
body beneficial different forms training. breathing hard
heart beating hard. certainly high intensity anaerobic
aerobic conditioning. 'Cause getting near VO2 max high intensity
aerobic conditioning, exceeding VO2 max high intensity anaerobic
conditioning. going happen course, heart beats faster, blood
going circulating faster principle. Oxygen utilization muscles going go
time, not long, quickly will happen capillary beds start
expand? talked that. addition, amount blood
returned heart, engage really intense bouts effort
repeatedly, amount blood returned heart actually causes east
centric loading one muscular walls heart. heart muscle.
cardiac muscle. skeletal muscle attached bones cardiac
muscle, heart. blood returned heart
additional work muscles nerves doing, actually effect
creating east centric loading, kind pushing wall, left wall. realize
not using strict anatomy here, don't want get features


structural features heart. left ventricle essentially getting slammed back
push back kind east centric loading cardiac muscle
muscle thickens, not heart thickens overall, actually
strengthening cardiac muscle way increases call stroke volume.
Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume
heart. high intensity type training heart beating
hard. maybe one-to-one ratio mile run repeats described minute ago.
say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver
fuel muscles brain, will notice can
work meaning can work days weeks ago
relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.

inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around

training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

okay? that, will build call anaerobic endurance.

01:07:00 Maximizing Oxygen Utilization, Heart Rate & Nerve-Muscle Energy Utilization

anaerobic endurance? Well, ask fail? Anaerobic endurance going
taking system greater 100% VO2 max. going taking
heart rate high going maximize oxygen utilization systems.
going effects going lead fatigue point

01:10:59 Aerobic HIIT; 1:1 Work:Rest Ratio, Tapping Energy Utilization Systems

want make sure touch fourth protocol high intensity aerobic
conditioning. HIIT two forms, anaerobic aerobic. just heard
anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training
extending sets one parameter expand. ratio
three one. 30 seconds 10 seconds off, one five, 20 seconds 100
seconds off, powerful tool building aerobic conditioning one-to-one
ratio. one-to-one ratio powerful building average. energy systems
involving, remember nerve muscle blood, heart lungs. one-to-one
ratio might run mile. however long takes, say takes six
minutes seven minutes, rest equivalent amount time.
repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles
26 miles. Well, not discouraging people ever long duration endurance.
think important. builds many energy
utilization systems. really teaches engage, excuse me, nerve muscle
firing. improves ATP mitochondrial function muscle. allows blood deliver
oxygen muscle brain. explain is. allows
heart deliver oxygen overall. builds tremendous lung capacity.
will talk exactly breathe build lung capacity. sake
warming performance. look like?
this? Well, really question workouts asking much work can one
eight 12 minutes, right? rest, repeat. much work can
eight 12 minutes rest repeat? many times
this? Well, sort thing pretty intense. probably
want two, maybe three times week not many things.
will talk program can moved forms training. just
give little hint now. clear described review article
referred will link another article well. concurrent training,
strength training endurance training four kinds describing
today can done. can program week. want get four
ideally six even better 24 hours workouts. hard,
instance, one-to-one mile repeats like run mile rest equivalent time, run
mile rest equivalent time two three times week, also weight
training long run afterwards. quickly lead break
people, unless very, good energy utilization systems. really
kind advanced elite athlete, dare say using tools enhance
performance level blood hormones. actually going talk
end work? four kinds endurance. Muscular
endurance. long-duration endurance. high intensity interval training


two kinds, anaerobic aerobic. last type, aerobic one works best.

01:15:20 Building Stronger Heart & Better Brain: Eccentric Loading Heart: Stroke

seems kind one-to-one ratio. use
actually doing? talk heart lungs oxygen,
something can benefit understanding. will become
clear discussion type training useful even non-athletes
order improve oxygenation energy utilization brain heart. brain
heart probably two important systems need take care

returned heart, engage really intense bouts effort
repeatedly, amount blood returned heart actually causes east
centric loading one muscular walls heart. heart muscle.
cardiac muscle. skeletal muscle attached bones cardiac
muscle, heart. blood returned heart
additional work muscles nerves doing, actually effect

strengthening cardiac muscle way increases call stroke volume.
Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume

hard. maybe one-to-one ratio mile run repeats described minute ago.
say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver
fuel muscles brain, will notice can
work meaning can work days weeks ago
relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types

Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various

things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves three 12 sets.
Starting off course, fewer sets getting training

minutes seven minutes, rest equivalent amount time.
repeat. rest equivalent amount time. might run first mile
say seven minutes. rest seven minutes. run mile again,
might take eight minutes rest eight minutes. continue


total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race

incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles

Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume
heart. high intensity type training heart beating

relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

front, can draft off them, actually kind aerodynamic effect
someone front makes easier run wake airstream.
speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going

them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional
gear? deeper resource? often express talk it, kind
psychological terms like heart willpower something kind got transplanted

running effort human, know, heart.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

total four miles work. Four miles running work, say. seven miles
work. can build up. Many people find using type training allows
things like go run half marathons marathons even though prior race
date, never actually run half marathon marathon. Now, might seem
incredible. like running mile on, resting running
mile resting equivalent amount time, running mile, resting
equivalent amount time seven miles allows run continuously 13 miles
26 miles. Well, not discouraging people ever long duration endurance.
think important. builds many energy
utilization systems. really teaches engage, excuse me, nerve muscle

eight 12 minutes rest repeat? many times
this? Well, sort thing pretty intense. probably
want two, maybe three times week not many things.
will talk program can moved forms training. just
give little hint now. clear described review article
referred will link another article well. concurrent training,
strength training endurance training four kinds describing
today can done. can program week. want get four
ideally six even better 24 hours workouts. hard,
instance, one-to-one mile repeats like run mile rest equivalent time, run
mile rest equivalent time two three times week, also weight

strengthening cardiac muscle way increases call stroke volume.
Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume
heart. high intensity type training heart beating
hard. maybe one-to-one ratio mile run repeats described minute ago.
say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver

relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon

high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter

try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2

system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,

appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

seems kind one-to-one ratio. use
actually doing? talk heart lungs oxygen,
something can benefit understanding. will become
clear discussion type training useful even non-athletes
order improve oxygenation energy utilization brain heart. brain

muscle thickens, not heart thickens overall, actually
strengthening cardiac muscle way increases call stroke volume.
Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume
heart. high intensity type training heart beating
hard. maybe one-to-one ratio mile run repeats described minute ago.
say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver

support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,

degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not

speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

comes supplementation lot variety. magnesium malate
shown reduce soreness sometimes good. Cold hot contrast
therapy soreness things sort. general, focused mainly today
behavioral tools. notice tools accessible without need lots
equipment. didn't say need rower, need kettlebell though will
work. hope able illustrate endurance isn't just one thing.
not just ability go long bouts exercise different kinds, also

depending big lawn is. use job kid mowing lawns
tell you, didn't many neighbors big lawns,
felt huge 'cause really convoluted. pushing mower,
old fashioned mowers not electric mowers, work. also

structural features heart. left ventricle essentially getting slammed back
push back kind east centric loading cardiac muscle
muscle thickens, not heart thickens overall, actually
strengthening cardiac muscle way increases call stroke volume.
Meaning blood returned heart. adaptation heart
muscle actually gets stronger therefore can pump blood per stroke per beat.
that, delivers blood contains glucose oxygen
things. delivers fuel muscles allows yet work per
unit time. Okay? hear that, oh, know, so-and-so maybe
nice low heart rate maybe one really extreme folks like 30
40 beats per minute, although people sitting 50, 60, 70, 80,
resting heart rate. exercise regularly long duration aerobic work,
heart rate will start go down, resting heart rate. will increase stroke volume
heart. high intensity type training heart beating
hard. maybe one-to-one ratio mile run repeats described minute ago.
say twice week three four. said, go way
12 rep sets, lot. don't recommend people start there. Pretty soon,
stroke volume heart will really increase. consequence, can deliver
fuel muscles brain, will notice can
work meaning can work days weeks ago
relative ease. cognitive functioning will improve. shown
again, increase vasculature. Literally, capillary beds within
brain, hippocampus areas support memory, also areas brain
support respiration, support focus, support effort. isn't often discussed,
ability deliver blood therefore glucose,

01:20:10 Resistance & Weight Training: Useless Brain? Good
Brain?

remember neurons run glucose oxygen brain big feature
exercise kind describing helps brain function. Now, weight training
positive effects brain function also. say weight training, really...
specific. really referring strength hypertrophy training.
Strength hypertrophy training especially sort get burn


talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard
get say, know, three sets eight deadlift
curls chin-ups kind thing. Okay? pretty easy get
mouse run treadmill can set tension treadmill make
easier harder mouse turn wheel. one reasons.
However, clear now understand intuitively kind
standard strength hypertrophy type workouts not going activate blood
oxygenation stroke volume increases heart sorts training
talking today will. just doesn't positive effects. Now, isn't
say just weight train dumb lose memory
time, might, say endurance work particular high intensity
long duration work talked today. two high intensity protocols
long duration work shown again, positive effects
brain function. Not addition new neurons, sorry break you,
not major event exercised non-exercised human brain, reasons
can talk future episode. still many positive effects
delivery things like IGF-1, also just plain oxygenation brain
way promotes development microvasculature develop, excuse me,
deliver new neurons nutrients. neurons don't get oxygen glucose,
die. Unless another fuel source like ketones can replace glucose.
don't give oxygen neurons, don't deliver enough them, get called
ischemia, get little micro strokes. type exercise talking today
generating intense heart rate increases provided safe do. Breathing hard,
going deliver oxygen blood, increase stroke volume heart going
improve brain function supported many, many quality peer-reviewed
studies. one form positive adaptation. also talked just sort
performance adaptations. high intensity aerobic conditioning mile
repeats type training can actually improve ability long bouts intense work.



01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types
training.

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum

Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move

endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

talked last episode start generating lactate hormonal signal
can benefit brain, et cetera. can positive effects brain.
frankly, haven't many studies resistance training strength
hypertrophy training brain function, mainly experiments
done mice primates, non-human primates, say. hard get mice
resistance training. Okay? hard get humans resistance training.
definitely hard get mice resistance training. ways it, hard

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training
intensity. Many people benefit one two full rest days per week. least
one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically
elevated not really putting brake system enough.
subconscious thing. ways can accelerate recovery,
encourage listen previous episode. time-stamped assess
recovery. often program things will depend things
doing. think perfectly reasonable type training types

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking

Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true

tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand

inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around

training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

01:23:25 Strength-Endurance Tradeoff; Long Wait Workouts

also seems like dovetails compatible resistance training aimed
towards strength hypertrophy. Now, full disclosure data seemed indicate
people just weight train train strength, three reps, rest five minutes, three
reps heavyweights, et cetera. Yeah, get much stronger
things like five repetitions 12, 12 25 reps going long
jogs. always going compromise adaptations, unfortunately
seem like can concurrent training mentioned before, allow anywhere
four six ideally 24 hours workouts. mentioned previous
episode, want know recovered workout? great way
apply carbon dioxide tolerance test, four breaths out, inhale,
exhale, inhale exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, big inhale slow
controlled exhale. slow controlled exhale 60 seconds longer, means
parasympathetic, calming nervous system control. likely,
say likely systemically whole nervous system recovered
whatever experiencing life including work
relationships. not, might want take rest day, dare say. Costello's
what? 10 now. think 12,000 thrust day. people need say,
one two full rest days per week. know people going say ridiculous
okay, maybe amazing recovery abilities, also depends training

one, people don't need to. not able extend exhale
carbon dioxide tolerance test past 60 seconds so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds chances
are, so-called sympathetic nervous system, stress system chronically

01:25:45 Breathing Endurance, Explosive Weight Training: Nose, Mouth,


Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

Gears

talk variety combinations toward end episode.
want talk deliver energy oxygen. tools
extremely useful, believe grounded physiology. three things like
talk about, breathe? immediately training hydration?
promise will get back programming sort protocols, vitally
important ability perform endurance work particular. grounded
neurons blood oxygen heart work together. first talk
breathing respiration. breathe couple different ways, just
remind breathe? breathe bring oxygen system,
breathe get rid carbon dioxide. need oxygen carbon dioxide
order utilize fuel brain body work. not oxygen good
carbon oxide bad. present appropriate ratios. one thing
clear ability deliver oxygen working muscles enter brain going
important ability generate muscular effort especially kind
talking today, also weight training forms skill-based effort, et
cetera. ability think. holding breath long,
breathing much, call over-breathing breathing,
shallow breathing, mouth breathing, things can really impede
mental physical performance. make really simple promise
future episode recipes. two main sources air body
air coming nose air coming mouth. general
nasal breathing better. scrubs air bacteria viruses.
microbiome nose benefits. number reasons, also just
efficient system believe not, even though feels like can gulp air
mouth. Getting good nasal breathing useful. gear - System type
Brian McKenzie colleagues developed, think good way
conceptualize this. long duration work, try nasal breathing.
deviated septum, probably cause don't nasal breathe enough. Mouth
breathing something many people suffer from. prone infections.
not efficient, et cetera. place mouth breathing. However, usually,
need strong exhale, oftentimes can discard volume
mouth, unless trained nasal breathing. high intensity


training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.

training, good way conceptualize exhale max effort,
inhale less intense part. might generating movement,
know, concentric part movement exhale, right? Just like bat
swing something like that, fighters martial artists differently depending
trained different purposes, kind like huh ssh,
kind exhaling effort inhaling portion repetition
not highest effort portion. Usually eccentric phase anything
involving rowing things sort. nasal breathing great,
increase intensity endurance work, will need incorporate mouth.
gear system look something like first gear just nasal breathing
second gear also just nasal breathing. effort, third gear again,
power speed endurance lot this. can go website. think
intelligent way conceptualize this. go max effort,
going third fourth fifth gear. point not thinking nose
mouth. just trying hang dear life complete work safely.
means breathe whatever orifice works you. one aspect, nose
versus mouth.

01:29:50 Intercostals & Diaphragmatic Breathing: Warming Intercostals Useful

aspect whether not using ribs, intercostal muscles
muscles Bruce Lee remarkable intercostal muscles allow
lift rib cage diaphragm skeletal muscle sits
lungs. Just remind you, inhale, diaphragm moves down,
exhale, diaphragm moves up. Okay? something people don't
benefit tremendously from. can say Andy Galpin's lab
done work exploring warming intercostals nerve diaphragm
pathways kind endurance work first minutes endurance
work can allow breathe deeply deliver oxygen blood,
[burps] excuse me, muscles able work efficiently.
involves sometimes sitting, sometimes standing just really
concentrating two things. always hear diaphragmatic
breathe. means belly moves inhale. [inhales deeply]
stomach expands, also expanding intercostals means actually raising


ribs, chest breathing.

01:31:00 Increasing Motivation & Adrenaline

told yoga class don't breathe chest this, [inhales deeply].
actually warming intercostal muscles. also great way
generate adrenaline little bit intensely. say feeling
unmotivated train, don't particularly like endurance training actually
it. use benefit practice just sit
three minutes just breathe deeply trying raise chest much can
maybe minute, contracting diaphragm expanding stomach
outward inhale. end actually delivering oxygen
system. lab looked totally different context. Andy's lab looked
context physical performance. warming breathing muscles
make sense, given now know muscles neurons need glucose
need oxygen order function. great warmup. can also
walking getting bike starting peddle, really starting think
warming breathing system. can decide want pure
nasal

01:32:10 Eliminating “Side Cramp” Physiological Sighs

combination nasal mouth breathing on. something
don't often hear about. one. tool, rather talked
previous episode, just mention again, people endurance type
work get stitch side. feel like got side cramp. rarely
actually skeletal muscular cramp, oftentimes referenced pain phrenic
nerve innervates liver. phrenic nerve responsible movement
diaphragm. important system, number call
collateral. branches organs. Runs organs. Sometimes
breathing shallow physical motion engaging physical
effort, feel side stitch. think, oh, got cramp maybe
dehydrated maybe need run hands head, excuse me. Typically,
can relieve side cramp, isn't cramp all. side stitch


double inhale, exhale, really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] sneaking little
bit air in. double kind firing call volume action potential
sent phrenic nerve diaphragm, will also activate collateral,
branch literally nerve innervates liver. exhale,
offload bunch carbon dioxide, repeat times often, fact,
every time often what'll happen side stitch will just naturally disappear. Just
means not breathing properly. phrenic nerve firing way
kind aggravating referenced pain. nothing kind voodoo mysterious
this. just way different nerves travel body.
set run maybe going muscular endurance work
high intensity work, warming intercostals, warming diaphragm good.
exercises work can strengthen intercostals
strengthen diaphragm bouts kind effort. say one
ways can best really focusing getting maximum
diaphragmatic expansion chest lifting. told now not do, know,
don't chest breathe, belly breathe. intercostals reason
perfectly good filling lungs. work best collaborate
diaphragm. starting fatigue start really inhale deeply try
really expand deliver oxygen system. talking
delivering oxygen

01:34:45 Accelerating “The Wall”: Accessing Alternative Fuel Sources; Ketone
Use

system, want share useful tool will now make total sense
mechanistically works, oftentimes long run long
duration bouts effort. will hit so-called wall, right? will bonk. think
used call it, still call Costello? asleep. bonk. just
think no, can't continue. curious thing whether not neural
whether not fuel-based, certainly going psychological
motivational component. one way can reveal kind extra gear,
capacity push understanding way different muscle fibers use energy
differently. Remember fast-twitch phosphocreatine system slow twitch
system relies mainly lipids glucose. Okay, well, even don't remember


that, running steadily long time starting fatigue
feel like time quit. may not tapped alternative fuel source.
One thing can can actually increase speed. also true
work repetitions kettlebells something. can start
increase speed. run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster not sprint.
that, shifting muscles nerves towards utilizing
separate fuel source distinct fuel source. Maybe phosphocreatine system
quick intense acceleration, maybe combination lipids
carbohydrates system weren't available prior. Now, course,
completely deplete liver glycogen, completely deplete everything,
going running stored fuel fats eventually start metabolizing
protein, muscles themselves. kind unique way realize that, oh,
weren't energy all, just over-relying one fuel source.
reason why, especially elite athletes starting rely carbohydrates.
whole carb depletion carb loading thing. loading
liver muscles plenty glycogen eating pastas rice stuff
races. also ingesting ketones races, long bouts effort,
ketones can quick form energy. no reason can't use
ketones taking exogenous ketones carbohydrate. combination,
remember body accustomed using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids,
carbohydrates things. the, know, internet age think
terms of, oh, well either keto burning sugar, fat adapted key
fat fasting fast fasting fat fatting. Costello woke said fat fatting. not
talking Costello. point body used using multiple fuel
sources. kind hitting wall, sometimes accelerating can actually allow
tap new fuel source combination fuel sources just based way
muscles use fuel. another tool.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

01:44:20 Boosting Mitochondrial Density Cold; Wait 6 Hours Cold/Between
Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &
Contraction; Pacing

want just pack in, 'cause closing month physical
performance. programming pacing kind mental
aspects endurance. start pacing mental aspects endurance.
learned friend colleague podcast that... active
triathlon marathon other... Knows lot whole world


competitive landscape there, pacing literally physical pacers laser
ground visualizing pace car pace runner front actually not
allowed many competitions. present doesn't allow race times
qualify legitimate record holding times. interesting
know visual system capacity switch back forth
call panoramic vision not really focused anything.
Things just flowing past us eyes just kind zoned out. can
right now won't able tell looking corners room. see
Costello floor. see podcast team can also see
microphone. can see environment. panoramic vision. Whereas
draw eyes one location like right center camera,
called vergence eye movement. contracting visual window. contraction
visual window done, thing happen
tracking say pace car pace runner laser ground. mere bringing
eyes together call vergence point impact triggering activation
neural circuits thalamus. Things like zona incerta, really want know
names are, brain areas. well brainstem activate
so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus, whereas panoramic vision tends
bring us states relaxation. can actually leverage us runs.
say long run swimming cycling. probably
easiest imagine water water well. focus
attention landmark going run to, find much easier
don't actually set milestone landmark going run to. However,
continue repeatedly just going milestone milestone,
milestone, feel mentally fatigued actually able
degenerate less work overall. One thing can useful focusing milestone,
running milestone biking whatever activity happens be,
dilating field view relax system continuing again. kind
active contraction visual window dilation visual window.
Contraction visual window allows generate effort cost
that, neurons consume energy. now know that.
Whereas dilation allows essentially efficient, right? Now, pacing not
allowed pacer, visual pacer allow access systems
brain body allow create energy, effort. find


interesting think kind subconscious genius race officials
governing bodies races said, okay, sure, pacer someone
front, can draft off them, actually kind aerodynamic effect
someone front makes easier run wake airstream.
speak. true cycling. cycling teams good
maneuvering packs. specific ways, can go faster less effort
drafting called behind somebody. well place vision will
allow generate effort. interesting taken kind
of, will, performance enhancing tool. imagine imagine
appropriate word here. good runners, good cyclists ability create kind
pacer minds eye. imagine not just completely allowing
attention drift, although want highly efficient mode
generating effort without tax mental capacity. remember mental
capacity neural energy consumes glucose energy devote
functioning body. needed can focus energy in,
actually kind chase mental pacer pick milestone. mental game
can play well. little bit hard context weightlifting gym.
moving space kind thing, people counting
reps, et cetera. think especially suitable endurance type exercise, especially
done outside. One reasons hate running treadmill just feels like
never ending. never tried one Peloton things. try avoid looking
screens much possibly can. try next time run
swim.

01:53:10 Physiological Basis “Extra Gear”, Accessing “Kick”, Steve
Prefontaine

find capacity engage system higher energy output
focus eyes particular location, want use judiciously

Steve Prefontaine. clear mostly battle himself,
also highly competitive individual. see races.
encourage look YouTube see docudramas.
quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going
win. going max effort least perceive max effort. Someone passes
them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional
gear? deeper resource? often express talk it, kind
psychological terms like heart willpower something kind got transplanted
us descended us. not remove spiritual aspects sport
running effort human, know, heart.

01:56:00 Programming Examples; Concurrent Training

clear nervous system specific visual target can
generate sorts intense effort couldn't otherwise. sometimes even
comes surprise person generating effort. promised talk


programming, meaning many times week various
workouts related endurance merge types exercise
might strength yoga things might like work
things, unrelated exercise. Since vast space many different
parameters different lives lifestyles backgrounds fitness,
et cetera. going going put three different levels will
protocols one adopt link show notes. caption
YouTube, click link, able see three possible combinations
endurance work, strength, hypertrophy work endurance work, flexibility
hypertrophy work grounded many major publications Dr. Andy
Galpin colleagues people described including review also
linked concurrent training one can use concurrent training, meaning
training endurance, training strength, training hypertrophy, training
different things without train constantly everyday twice day, et cetera.
interested taking protocols learned episode
previous episodes combining those, placed
completely zero cost resource. Please understand not wholly... Costello agrees.
not wholly. will variation terms people can tolerate
time for? think serve useful guideline getting started
continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2

consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts

assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,

continuing expanding existing endurance work, strength work,
hypertrophy work forth. Just really quickly.

01:57:57 Caffeine, Magnesium Malate Reduce Soreness, Nitric Oxide, Beta-Alanine

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
evidence caffeine intake can actually inhibit function creating system,
just one study. interesting. want read study, can put
caffeine www.examine.com will take study. Many people get sore
workouts, particular workouts involve lot eccentric loading workouts


novel kind pushed instead moving gradually
suggest say high intensity anaerobic endurance work three sets 20 seconds
100 seconds rest. Maybe get ambitious eight sets. case
extremely sore. Certain forms magnesium particular, magnesium malate,
M-A-L-A-T-E. shown useful removing reducing amount
delayed onset muscle soreness. form magnesium distinctly different
sorts magnesium good getting us sleep. Things like magnesium three
eight Bisglycinate. whole thing beet powder
beet juices things increase nitric oxide allow vasodilation
therefore delivery blood muscle neurons tissues long bouts
endurance work. people like beet juice related compounds increase
arginine vasodilation. people don't. people don't feel good
take those. people also don't feel good take beta alanine,
can give feeling kind like itchy, creepy crawlies skin kind
niacin phenomenon, niacin flush. people don't mind that, people don't
experience that.

01:37:50 Hydration: Hydrate, Hydrate, & Much Fluid Drink

thing really important think terms endurance type work
hydration. think hydration important forms physical work exercise
not just endurance. deal hydration taught hydration
wrong. remember neurons work on? use order fire?


Well, certainly need water, right? need water system, say.
remember use electrolytes, sodium potassium generate action
potentials actually get neurons contract, able, excuse me, muscles contract
brain function able think. Typically, going lose
anywhere one five pounds water per hour exercise. going vary
tremendously, going vary weather, going vary intensity, probably
like five pounds, hot day exercising intensely. one five
pounds per hour. Now, know much weigh. think weight
pounds, lose one 4% body weight water, going
experience 20 30% reduction work capacity. ability generate
effort kind, strength, endurance, et cetera. also going experience
significant drop ability think perform mental operations. hydration
key. Now, many people told, well, urinate urine clear, well,
hydrated enough. Sometimes true. Sometimes not true. Also
isn't topic enjoyed discussing, urine biological phenomenon. actually
filtered blood every kid family friend, say,
"Did know pee "is actually filtered blood?" usually kind go
wide-eyed. go, "Oh, kind cool." Like kids natural curiosity
blood pee stuff. not contaminated preconceived notions
things gross, filtered blood can give
indication whether not hydrated enough not. order really
assess that, not going sufficient urinate another volume water
assess whether not urine dark light. actually requires urinating
small volume saying, well, darker lighter before? not something
really want places. etiquette gyms environments not
suitable that. one things can just configure, well,
going lose one five pounds water per hour. can show exercise
reasonably hydrated electrolytes. potassium, sodium magnesium really
key. Yes, true, can die drinking much water particular
forces you, drink much water, excrete many electrolytes brain
will shut off. actually heart will stop functioning properly. don't want
consume extreme either, number equations go
figuring much water need based intense training, et cetera,
body size, et cetera. Just remember burn, lose, excuse one five


pounds water per hour, depending hot is, intensely
exercising. body weight drops one 4%. can just figure, well,
lose five pounds per hour, exercise two hours. say 200
pounds, 10%. Okay? Well, want replace quickly
not. want replace along start experiencing

01:41:35 “The Galpin Equation”; Gastric Emptying Time, Adapting Hydration Mid-
Training

massive 20 30% reduction work capacity muscles brain. simple
formula. call it, Galpin equation. Hereafter, referred Galpin equation
formula gets close exact amount want Dr. Andy
Galpin came with, body weight pounds divided number 30.
many ounces drink every 15 minutes exercise.
again, Galpin equation. body weight pounds divided 30.
amount fluid drink ounces, right? Every 15 minutes exercise. Now,
sweating lot, may need more. Okay? already well hydrated, may
need less, good rule thumb begin start understand
relationship hydration performance. phenomenon
gastric emptying, ability move stuff gut, including water electrolytes
gut bloodstream delivery tissues body
effort hindered get 70% VO2 max. words
high intensity training sometimes people experience ingesting water
intense training difficult. something can actually trained up. matter
learning kind relax abdominal muscles. aspects
adaptation will allow drink higher intensity work. Galpin says, don't
try ingest fluids working competing higher 70% VO2
max never done before. want train capacity. People can learn
consume fluids race consume fluids bouts exercise
intense. lot people don't want that, 'cause don't want
stop urinate, et cetera. given crucial role hydration muscular
performance brain performance, seems going lot
high intensity interval training various concepts talked today high intensity
training kind hydration key learning words, getting


system adapt ingesting fluids middle workouts something
seems beneficial. least me, terms trade off dehydrated
somewhat discomfort maybe drinking fluids. sip small amounts
fluid initially able take bigger bigger gulps time goes on.
pretty soon able drink mid-set be, excuse me, not mid-set. Please don't
sets workout

Training

still breathing hard mile repeat something sort without
much disruption performance. Last episode talked
assess recovery things might want improve recovery,
exposure ice baths cold showers can reduce inflammation can great
recovery, can inhibit adaptations strength hypertrophy.
inflammation isn't good bad. Inflammation isn't like nice person mean person.
both. great thing stimulating adaptations, don't want around
long. suggested not ice baths within probably six hours
training goal hypertrophy strength training. evidence
getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift
Training



think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

01:48:00 Leveraging Visual System Effort, Milestones; Dilation &

realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed

getting ice bath cold shower endurance training can actually
improve mitochondrial aspects endurance exercise can get improvements
mitochondrial density, can get improvements mitochondrial respiration
afterwards can facilitate recovery. still bit controversial
area. think mentioned earlier waiting least six hours probably
like 24 hours workouts good idea. getting least one full day
rest week, people that'll two. say one people
two days absolutely no exercise, perform better consistently across
aspects physical performance mentally feel better well even though load
take days off unless really exhausted seem help training.
people can train seven days week fine.

01:46:00 Accelerating Recovery 5 Minute Parasympathetic Down-Shift

think just lot individual variation. want work sleep
maximizing sleep recovery nutrition, course, well. talked sleep first
four episodes podcast. trouble sleep definitely check
episodes. clear number sports teams even folks work with,
Andy Galpin others starting incorporate called
parasympathetic down-regulation training kind way accelerate
recovery enable work. words, get back work sooner.
parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes
minimum, maybe ideally like 10 20, sake time five minutes minimum
just slow pure nasal long exhale breathing lying just kind
zoning out. seems can accelerate recovery allow get back
types work, mental work physical work quickly makes total sense
remember nervous system recovery work local phenomenon
muscles using. know, using glutes, hams
back using shoulders, et cetera. also systemic thing. also
neurons locus coeruleus releasing epinephrine want
quiet training. want really just zone out. Think Costello,
channel inner Costello, just mellow five 20 minutes move
rest day. Five minutes manageable. Even just sitting
car eyes closed downregulation breathing. think see big
benefits terms allowing come back sooner, work time
just perform feel better generally, well able think things
besides just much previous workout kind beat up. couple
things think going useful.

parasympathetic downregulation? means finishing training instead
just hopping phone hopping car heading off take five minutes

Steve Prefontaine. clear mostly battle himself,
also highly competitive individual. see races.

quite good. ran the... Essentially 12 laps track. essentially
five. 5,000 meter race essentially three miles. essentially tried
sprint whole thing ridiculous. Actually knowing know today
realize Steve Prefontaine basically pulling strength, speed, power,
muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic sort
tried maximize every fuel system. see races runs,
runners nearing final laps, so-called bell lap race, often look
one another see somebody obviously assess progress
close somebody is? somebody gets past, oftentimes see someone
access mysterious kick, ability tap additional gear allows
run forward faster actually thought maxed
out. someone running finish line. convinced going
win. going max effort least perceive max effort. Someone passes
them. sudden max effort changed, visual target
able access higher levels speed output effort performance. don't
always catch person win, target milestone powerful
way can generate force energy anything. visual system
way bring milestones brain, brings
epinephrin, brings neural firing, allows us access whatever
resources happen available us. find fascinating people often
wonder, like kick come from? kind gift additional

didn't talk supplements much today. previous episodes talked
phosphocreatine system supplementing creatine, talked beta
alanine kind moderate duration work. know really things
shown really improve endurance work across four varieties endurance
work described today. essentially two forms. One, stimulants. things
like caffeine will definitely improve endurance work power output. little bit
