conversation Dr. Matthew Johnson. Well, Matthew, looking forward
long time. huge fan scientific work, learn you. So-
- Likewise. Big fan happy you. - right, well, thank you. first
question basic one, is, psychedelic? hear term
time, qualifies substance psychedelic? - Nomenclature real
challenge area psychedelics. starting word psychedelic,
pharmacologist, not satisfying, term really spans different
pharmacological classes. words, really concerned receptor
effects basic effects compound, spans several classes compounds.
overall... really cultural term, relationship drug
effects, high level. so-called psychedelics across
distinct classes can talk about, way put it, ability
profoundly alter one's sense reality, can mean many things. Part
profoundly altering sense self acutely, someone's psychedelic.
different classes can be, specific pharmacological classes can called
psychedelic, are, one, called classic psychedelics. literature,
see term. Hallucinogen psychedelic traditionally used
synonymously. think little tendency stay away psychedelics,
baggage, return last several years.
classic psychedelics classic hallucinogens things like LSD, psilocybin,
so-called magic mushrooms. 200 species know far
mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine, DMT, dozens dozens plants.
Mescalin, peyote cacti, cacti, like San Pedro. even
amongst classic psychedelics two structural, structural classes.
chemistry. tryptamine-based compounds, like psilocybin DMT,
phenethylamine-based compounds. basic, two the,
basically, building blocks starting from, either tryptamine structure
phenethylamine structure. just chemistry. the...
important, least someone like me, receptor effects, then, ultimately,
going relationship behavioral subjective effects.
classic psychedelics serve agonist, partial agonists, serotonin 2A
receptor, subtype serotonin receptor. classes


compounds call psychedelic. Another big one NMDA
antagonist. include ketamine, PCP, dextromethorphan, something
done research with, folks might recognize like Robo-tripping, guzzling
cough syrup, something kind like high school kids known
can't get ahold real drugs, type thing. large overlap types
subjective effects get compounds compared 2A agonist
classic psychedelics. have... way, description,
framework describing, not everyone will agree. people will say, no,
psychedelic means classic psychedelic. different opinions here.
have, gosh, Salvinorin A, kappa-opioid agonist, again- -
come from? - Salvia divinorum, plant became... 20 years ago, sort
popped onto legal high scene, long history predating
internet, going back like stuff one order back "High Times
Magazine", stuff never worked, know? [laughs] like, just
smoke enough anything, maybe get little bit lightheaded. one
things popped around 20 years ago, quickly got reputation like, holy
shit, stuff actually works, works really strongly. smoked extracts
particularly, people reality-altering experiences par smoked DMT,
classic psychedelic. often... first blinded controlled human research
Salvinorin A. lots entity contact. feeling you, experience one
actually interacting autonomous beings, type thing.
another big one, probably mentioned even Salvinorin A,
MDMA, really stands class itself. called entactogen,
and- - mean? - means like touching within. sort alludes idea
can really put someone touch emotions. also called
empathogen, meaning can afford empathy. think entactogen's probably,
term tend focus on. know not telling anything don't know,
viewers, primary mechanism MDMA serotonin release, degree,
monoamine release, dopamine, serotonin. structurally, also
phenethylamine class, contains mescalin, classic psychedelic, also
amphetamine. just like Adderall phenethylamine class.
another example chemistry doesn't dictate. mean, can tweak molecule.
might basic structure, now profoundly changed way
interacts receptor. MDMA not exert actions by, like say,


mimicking baseball entering glove, post-synaptic receptor side acting
agonist. mimicking endogenous neurotransmitter, serotonin, like classic
psychedelics do. MDMA works pitcher side just basically throwing
natural, endogenous- - Dumping serotonin. - Dumping serotonin. -
Yeah. - Flooding synapse. - Yeah. get impression, psychedelic
space enormous cloud partially overlapping compounds. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. -
Meaning impacting serotonin system dopamine system.
Others impacting dopamine system serotonin system. Given
definition psychedelic profoundly alters sense self, least
included partial definition, - Mm-hmm.

00:14:09 Hallucinations, Synesthesia, Altered Space-Time Perception

- can break couple sub categories? instance, hallucinating,
either auditory visual, synesthesia, perceptual blending, sense can hear
colors, see sounds, instance. common report people - Yeah. - take
psychedelics sufficiently high doses. hallucinating, synesthesia. terms
sense self, neuroscientist, think, okay, mean alter sense
reality? Really, brain coarse way try figure
happening space, physical space, physical space within us
outside us, happening time. - Right. - vision scientist, simplest
explanation, move hand one location another location,
measuring space, location hand space time, get
rate, speed, kind stuff, right? - Yeah. - gets complicated
get emotional realm. fair say, psychedelics impacting
space-time analysis brain performing, thereby creating hallucinations,
thereby altering blending senses? fair say that? - think fair
explore area, thinking. Clearly, changed relationship,
certainly, right dose orientation space-time. think a... know,
primarily behaviorist, terms human behavioral pharmacology, always go
comparative pharmacology, okay? can say truly unique classic
psychedelic, psychedelics general? description, thinking, okay,
alcohol can really screw time-space orientation. - proprioception,
balance, vestibular. - Proprioception, - Yeah. - know. many ways,


sort gross motorways, like far worse, course everything's dose-dependent,
classic psychedelics, obviously benzodiazepines similar
alcohol. thing. want dig little more, terms of, like, maybe
something specific say relationship time, space
psychedelics tinkering with, not sure. interesting hypothesis, idea
mediator, something, something fundamental
changing representation time space. might something that.
mean, think psychedelics profoundly altering models. prediction
machines. much top-down. psychedelics good way of, loosely
speaking, dissolving models, one of, reality- - Can give us example
one of, like model? Like, know throw ball air, falls down, not
up. prediction learned child. not come world brain
knew relationship - Yes. - objects gravity. one first
things child learns relationship objects, gravity,
trajectory- - Yeah. four-year-old, mean, saw earlier ages, like
experimentation of, like, oh yeah, happens, know? - Right. [interposing
voices] throw ball, child throw ball, went
sky, absolutely mind-blowing? - Yeah. - adult too. - It'd
pretty - Right. - psychedelic experience, probably [laughs]. - Right, right.
rule there. saying, kind prediction. - Right. - rule
underlies prediction, rule violated, sudden, circuit,
presumably, prediction, doesn't mind own, somehow,
creates surprise element, recognition element. - Yeah. not filtered out,
know? might sound extreme, cases, overblown,
sort propaganda late '60s, early '70s, credible cases people,
atypical of, sounds like really thought fly, jump
window. Now, far people every year fall. mean, knows, know? - Sure. -
fall die of, know, height, drunk, know?
extremely rare, pretty convincing cases. one
research volunteer studies that, looked like was, one studies,
trying dive painting wall. fine. [laughs]...
Reviewing video, looked like really thought going go
painting, knows? know mean? - right, so- was- -
dimension- - Yeah, violating predictions. Yeah, reason


asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,
end day, chemical, receptors scattered around brain
billions receptors. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - think going
general sense? - Yeah, yeah, really area active exploration,
don't great answers. know good amount receptor level
pharmacology, things post-receptor signaling pathways. words, just
fitting receptor. Clearly, serotonin not psychedelic, know? else
tripping, us, time. - 'Cause eat bagel, get serotonin
release, right? - Uh-huh. - mean, there's... turkey. - different LSD.
- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate
experience. Whereas dopamine system really places us external view
world, possible. - Yeah. - fair say? - Need
something. mean, consistent understanding, certainly, not


terms of... don't primarily identify neuroscientist, definitely tell viewers
far domain mine. terms psychedelics
drugs interface neuroscience level. - Well, feel free explain
experiential level. - Yeah. - mean, doesn't have- think probably
audience members interested in, 5-H2C? layer five neurons
cortex? - Yeah. - conversation, hold, interesting
conversation. just terms experience serotonergic versus dopaminergic
drugs, - Right. Yeah. - seem create distinct classes experience. think
appropriate level - Right. - us discuss them. - terms they...
like explore biology little bit here, tell sort known,
ideas are. - [Dr. Huberman] Please. - know, path...
know, levels analysis, not one going on. almost like,
particular question, level analysis appropriate? question best
addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

conversation Dr. Matthew Johnson. Well, Matthew, looking forward
long time. huge fan scientific work, learn you. So-
- Likewise. Big fan happy you. - right, well, thank you. first
question basic one, is, psychedelic? hear term
time, qualifies substance psychedelic? - Nomenclature real
challenge area psychedelics. starting word psychedelic,
pharmacologist, not satisfying, term really spans different
pharmacological classes. words, really concerned receptor
effects basic effects compound, spans several classes compounds.
overall... really cultural term, relationship drug
effects, high level. so-called psychedelics across
distinct classes can talk about, way put it, ability
profoundly alter one's sense reality, can mean many things. Part
profoundly altering sense self acutely, someone's psychedelic.
different classes can be, specific pharmacological classes can called
psychedelic, are, one, called classic psychedelics. literature,
see term. Hallucinogen psychedelic traditionally used
synonymously. think little tendency stay away psychedelics,
baggage, return last several years.
classic psychedelics classic hallucinogens things like LSD, psilocybin,
so-called magic mushrooms. 200 species know far
mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine, DMT, dozens dozens plants.
Mescalin, peyote cacti, cacti, like San Pedro. even
amongst classic psychedelics two structural, structural classes.
chemistry. tryptamine-based compounds, like psilocybin DMT,
phenethylamine-based compounds. basic, two the,
basically, building blocks starting from, either tryptamine structure
phenethylamine structure. just chemistry. the...
important, least someone like me, receptor effects, then, ultimately,
going relationship behavioral subjective effects.
classic psychedelics serve agonist, partial agonists, serotonin 2A
receptor, subtype serotonin receptor. classes


compounds call psychedelic. Another big one NMDA
antagonist. include ketamine, PCP, dextromethorphan, something
done research with, folks might recognize like Robo-tripping, guzzling
cough syrup, something kind like high school kids known
can't get ahold real drugs, type thing. large overlap types
subjective effects get compounds compared 2A agonist
classic psychedelics. have... way, description,
framework describing, not everyone will agree. people will say, no,
psychedelic means classic psychedelic. different opinions here.
have, gosh, Salvinorin A, kappa-opioid agonist, again- -
come from? - Salvia divinorum, plant became... 20 years ago, sort
popped onto legal high scene, long history predating
internet, going back like stuff one order back "High Times
Magazine", stuff never worked, know? [laughs] like, just
smoke enough anything, maybe get little bit lightheaded. one
things popped around 20 years ago, quickly got reputation like, holy
shit, stuff actually works, works really strongly. smoked extracts
particularly, people reality-altering experiences par smoked DMT,
classic psychedelic. often... first blinded controlled human research
Salvinorin A. lots entity contact. feeling you, experience one
actually interacting autonomous beings, type thing.
another big one, probably mentioned even Salvinorin A,
MDMA, really stands class itself. called entactogen,
and- - mean? - means like touching within. sort alludes idea
can really put someone touch emotions. also called
empathogen, meaning can afford empathy. think entactogen's probably,
term tend focus on. know not telling anything don't know,
viewers, primary mechanism MDMA serotonin release, degree,
monoamine release, dopamine, serotonin. structurally, also
phenethylamine class, contains mescalin, classic psychedelic, also
amphetamine. just like Adderall phenethylamine class.
another example chemistry doesn't dictate. mean, can tweak molecule.
might basic structure, now profoundly changed way
interacts receptor. MDMA not exert actions by, like say,


mimicking baseball entering glove, post-synaptic receptor side acting
agonist. mimicking endogenous neurotransmitter, serotonin, like classic
psychedelics do. MDMA works pitcher side just basically throwing
natural, endogenous- - Dumping serotonin. - Dumping serotonin. -
Yeah. - Flooding synapse. - Yeah. get impression, psychedelic
space enormous cloud partially overlapping compounds. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. -
Meaning impacting serotonin system dopamine system.
Others impacting dopamine system serotonin system. Given
definition psychedelic profoundly alters sense self, least
included partial definition, - Mm-hmm.

00:14:09 Hallucinations, Synesthesia, Altered Space-Time Perception

- can break couple sub categories? instance, hallucinating,
either auditory visual, synesthesia, perceptual blending, sense can hear
colors, see sounds, instance. common report people - Yeah. - take
psychedelics sufficiently high doses. hallucinating, synesthesia. terms
sense self, neuroscientist, think, okay, mean alter sense
reality? Really, brain coarse way try figure
happening space, physical space, physical space within us
outside us, happening time. - Right. - vision scientist, simplest
explanation, move hand one location another location,
measuring space, location hand space time, get
rate, speed, kind stuff, right? - Yeah. - gets complicated
get emotional realm. fair say, psychedelics impacting
space-time analysis brain performing, thereby creating hallucinations,
thereby altering blending senses? fair say that? - think fair
explore area, thinking. Clearly, changed relationship,
certainly, right dose orientation space-time. think a... know,
primarily behaviorist, terms human behavioral pharmacology, always go
comparative pharmacology, okay? can say truly unique classic
psychedelic, psychedelics general? description, thinking, okay,
alcohol can really screw time-space orientation. - proprioception,
balance, vestibular. - Proprioception, - Yeah. - know. many ways,


sort gross motorways, like far worse, course everything's dose-dependent,
classic psychedelics, obviously benzodiazepines similar
alcohol. thing. want dig little more, terms of, like, maybe
something specific say relationship time, space
psychedelics tinkering with, not sure. interesting hypothesis, idea
mediator, something, something fundamental
changing representation time space. might something that.
mean, think psychedelics profoundly altering models. prediction
machines. much top-down. psychedelics good way of, loosely
speaking, dissolving models, one of, reality- - Can give us example
one of, like model? Like, know throw ball air, falls down, not
up. prediction learned child. not come world brain
knew relationship - Yes. - objects gravity. one first
things child learns relationship objects, gravity,
trajectory- - Yeah. four-year-old, mean, saw earlier ages, like
experimentation of, like, oh yeah, happens, know? - Right. [interposing
voices] throw ball, child throw ball, went
sky, absolutely mind-blowing? - Yeah. - adult too. - It'd
pretty - Right. - psychedelic experience, probably [laughs]. - Right, right.
rule there. saying, kind prediction. - Right. - rule
underlies prediction, rule violated, sudden, circuit,
presumably, prediction, doesn't mind own, somehow,
creates surprise element, recognition element. - Yeah. not filtered out,
know? might sound extreme, cases, overblown,
sort propaganda late '60s, early '70s, credible cases people,
atypical of, sounds like really thought fly, jump
window. Now, far people every year fall. mean, knows, know? - Sure. -
fall die of, know, height, drunk, know?
extremely rare, pretty convincing cases. one
research volunteer studies that, looked like was, one studies,
trying dive painting wall. fine. [laughs]...
Reviewing video, looked like really thought going go
painting, knows? know mean? - right, so- was- -
dimension- - Yeah, violating predictions. Yeah, reason


asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,
end day, chemical, receptors scattered around brain
billions receptors. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - think going
general sense? - Yeah, yeah, really area active exploration,
don't great answers. know good amount receptor level
pharmacology, things post-receptor signaling pathways. words, just
fitting receptor. Clearly, serotonin not psychedelic, know? else
tripping, us, time. - 'Cause eat bagel, get serotonin
release, right? - Uh-huh. - mean, there's... turkey. - different LSD.
- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate
experience. Whereas dopamine system really places us external view
world, possible. - Yeah. - fair say? - Need
something. mean, consistent understanding, certainly, not


terms of... don't primarily identify neuroscientist, definitely tell viewers
far domain mine. terms psychedelics
drugs interface neuroscience level. - Well, feel free explain
experiential level. - Yeah. - mean, doesn't have- think probably
audience members interested in, 5-H2C? layer five neurons
cortex? - Yeah. - conversation, hold, interesting
conversation. just terms experience serotonergic versus dopaminergic
drugs, - Right. Yeah. - seem create distinct classes experience. think
appropriate level - Right. - us discuss them. - terms they...
like explore biology little bit here, tell sort known,
ideas are. - [Dr. Huberman] Please. - know, path...
know, levels analysis, not one going on. almost like,
particular question, level analysis appropriate? question best
addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

compounds call psychedelic. Another big one NMDA
antagonist. include ketamine, PCP, dextromethorphan, something
done research with, folks might recognize like Robo-tripping, guzzling
cough syrup, something kind like high school kids known
can't get ahold real drugs, type thing. large overlap types
subjective effects get compounds compared 2A agonist
classic psychedelics. have... way, description,
framework describing, not everyone will agree. people will say, no,
psychedelic means classic psychedelic. different opinions here.
have, gosh, Salvinorin A, kappa-opioid agonist, again- -
come from? - Salvia divinorum, plant became... 20 years ago, sort
popped onto legal high scene, long history predating
internet, going back like stuff one order back "High Times
Magazine", stuff never worked, know? [laughs] like, just
smoke enough anything, maybe get little bit lightheaded. one
things popped around 20 years ago, quickly got reputation like, holy
shit, stuff actually works, works really strongly. smoked extracts
particularly, people reality-altering experiences par smoked DMT,
classic psychedelic. often... first blinded controlled human research
Salvinorin A. lots entity contact. feeling you, experience one
actually interacting autonomous beings, type thing.
another big one, probably mentioned even Salvinorin A,
MDMA, really stands class itself. called entactogen,
and- - mean? - means like touching within. sort alludes idea
can really put someone touch emotions. also called
empathogen, meaning can afford empathy. think entactogen's probably,
term tend focus on. know not telling anything don't know,
viewers, primary mechanism MDMA serotonin release, degree,
monoamine release, dopamine, serotonin. structurally, also
phenethylamine class, contains mescalin, classic psychedelic, also
amphetamine. just like Adderall phenethylamine class.
another example chemistry doesn't dictate. mean, can tweak molecule.
might basic structure, now profoundly changed way
interacts receptor. MDMA not exert actions by, like say,


mimicking baseball entering glove, post-synaptic receptor side acting
agonist. mimicking endogenous neurotransmitter, serotonin, like classic
psychedelics do. MDMA works pitcher side just basically throwing
natural, endogenous- - Dumping serotonin. - Dumping serotonin. -
Yeah. - Flooding synapse. - Yeah. get impression, psychedelic
space enormous cloud partially overlapping compounds. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. -
Meaning impacting serotonin system dopamine system.
Others impacting dopamine system serotonin system. Given
definition psychedelic profoundly alters sense self, least
included partial definition, - Mm-hmm.

00:14:09 Hallucinations, Synesthesia, Altered Space-Time Perception

- can break couple sub categories? instance, hallucinating,
either auditory visual, synesthesia, perceptual blending, sense can hear
colors, see sounds, instance. common report people - Yeah. - take
psychedelics sufficiently high doses. hallucinating, synesthesia. terms
sense self, neuroscientist, think, okay, mean alter sense
reality? Really, brain coarse way try figure
happening space, physical space, physical space within us
outside us, happening time. - Right. - vision scientist, simplest
explanation, move hand one location another location,
measuring space, location hand space time, get
rate, speed, kind stuff, right? - Yeah. - gets complicated
get emotional realm. fair say, psychedelics impacting
space-time analysis brain performing, thereby creating hallucinations,
thereby altering blending senses? fair say that? - think fair
explore area, thinking. Clearly, changed relationship,
certainly, right dose orientation space-time. think a... know,
primarily behaviorist, terms human behavioral pharmacology, always go
comparative pharmacology, okay? can say truly unique classic
psychedelic, psychedelics general? description, thinking, okay,
alcohol can really screw time-space orientation. - proprioception,
balance, vestibular. - Proprioception, - Yeah. - know. many ways,


sort gross motorways, like far worse, course everything's dose-dependent,
classic psychedelics, obviously benzodiazepines similar
alcohol. thing. want dig little more, terms of, like, maybe
something specific say relationship time, space
psychedelics tinkering with, not sure. interesting hypothesis, idea
mediator, something, something fundamental
changing representation time space. might something that.
mean, think psychedelics profoundly altering models. prediction
machines. much top-down. psychedelics good way of, loosely
speaking, dissolving models, one of, reality- - Can give us example
one of, like model? Like, know throw ball air, falls down, not
up. prediction learned child. not come world brain
knew relationship - Yes. - objects gravity. one first
things child learns relationship objects, gravity,
trajectory- - Yeah. four-year-old, mean, saw earlier ages, like
experimentation of, like, oh yeah, happens, know? - Right. [interposing
voices] throw ball, child throw ball, went
sky, absolutely mind-blowing? - Yeah. - adult too. - It'd
pretty - Right. - psychedelic experience, probably [laughs]. - Right, right.
rule there. saying, kind prediction. - Right. - rule
underlies prediction, rule violated, sudden, circuit,
presumably, prediction, doesn't mind own, somehow,
creates surprise element, recognition element. - Yeah. not filtered out,
know? might sound extreme, cases, overblown,
sort propaganda late '60s, early '70s, credible cases people,
atypical of, sounds like really thought fly, jump
window. Now, far people every year fall. mean, knows, know? - Sure. -
fall die of, know, height, drunk, know?
extremely rare, pretty convincing cases. one
research volunteer studies that, looked like was, one studies,
trying dive painting wall. fine. [laughs]...
Reviewing video, looked like really thought going go
painting, knows? know mean? - right, so- was- -
dimension- - Yeah, violating predictions. Yeah, reason


asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,
end day, chemical, receptors scattered around brain
billions receptors. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - think going
general sense? - Yeah, yeah, really area active exploration,
don't great answers. know good amount receptor level
pharmacology, things post-receptor signaling pathways. words, just
fitting receptor. Clearly, serotonin not psychedelic, know? else
tripping, us, time. - 'Cause eat bagel, get serotonin
release, right? - Uh-huh. - mean, there's... turkey. - different LSD.
- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate
experience. Whereas dopamine system really places us external view
world, possible. - Yeah. - fair say? - Need
something. mean, consistent understanding, certainly, not


terms of... don't primarily identify neuroscientist, definitely tell viewers
far domain mine. terms psychedelics
drugs interface neuroscience level. - Well, feel free explain
experiential level. - Yeah. - mean, doesn't have- think probably
audience members interested in, 5-H2C? layer five neurons
cortex? - Yeah. - conversation, hold, interesting
conversation. just terms experience serotonergic versus dopaminergic
drugs, - Right. Yeah. - seem create distinct classes experience. think
appropriate level - Right. - us discuss them. - terms they...
like explore biology little bit here, tell sort known,
ideas are. - [Dr. Huberman] Please. - know, path...
know, levels analysis, not one going on. almost like,
particular question, level analysis appropriate? question best
addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,

- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate

audience members interested in, 5-H2C? layer five neurons

conversation. just terms experience serotonergic versus dopaminergic
drugs, - Right. Yeah. - seem create distinct classes experience. think
appropriate level - Right. - us discuss them. - terms they...
like explore biology little bit here, tell sort known,
ideas are. - [Dr. Huberman] Please. - know, path...
know, levels analysis, not one going on. almost like,
particular question, level analysis appropriate? question best
addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

sort gross motorways, like far worse, course everything's dose-dependent,
classic psychedelics, obviously benzodiazepines similar
alcohol. thing. want dig little more, terms of, like, maybe
something specific say relationship time, space
psychedelics tinkering with, not sure. interesting hypothesis, idea
mediator, something, something fundamental
changing representation time space. might something that.
mean, think psychedelics profoundly altering models. prediction
machines. much top-down. psychedelics good way of, loosely
speaking, dissolving models, one of, reality- - Can give us example
one of, like model? Like, know throw ball air, falls down, not
up. prediction learned child. not come world brain
knew relationship - Yes. - objects gravity. one first
things child learns relationship objects, gravity,

presumably, prediction, doesn't mind own, somehow,
creates surprise element, recognition element. - Yeah. not filtered out,
know? might sound extreme, cases, overblown,
sort propaganda late '60s, early '70s, credible cases people,
atypical of, sounds like really thought fly, jump

fall die of, know, height, drunk, know?
extremely rare, pretty convincing cases. one
research volunteer studies that, looked like was, one studies,
trying dive painting wall. fine. [laughs]...
Reviewing video, looked like really thought going go
painting, knows? know mean? - right, so- was- -
dimension- - Yeah, violating predictions. Yeah, reason


asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,
end day, chemical, receptors scattered around brain
billions receptors. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - think going
general sense? - Yeah, yeah, really area active exploration,
don't great answers. know good amount receptor level
pharmacology, things post-receptor signaling pathways. words, just
fitting receptor. Clearly, serotonin not psychedelic, know? else
tripping, us, time. - 'Cause eat bagel, get serotonin
release, right? - Uh-huh. - mean, there's... turkey. - different LSD.
- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate
experience. Whereas dopamine system really places us external view
world, possible. - Yeah. - fair say? - Need

addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

asked question way is, given enormous cloud different
substances, given range previous experiences people show
psychedelic experience with, feel like ability extract universal themes
useful, especially people haven't done before, right? - Yeah.

00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine

- might not understanding effects like. Can just briefly
touch serotonin system dopamine system? want acknowledge that,
already know, many neuromodulator systems body,
opioid systems, cannabinoid systems. something profound
serotonin system dopamine system, way define neuromodulator
is, modulator. changes way circuits behave. essentially,
increases probability certain circuits will active decreases probability
circuits will active, - Yeah. - general sense. - Mm-hmm. -
compounds like LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide psilocybin, understanding,
primarily target serotonin system. kind general
level? increasing activity particular serotonin receptor batch
serotonin receptors lead profoundly different experiences calling
model challenges, challenging pre-existing models predictions? - Yeah. - mean,
end day, chemical, receptors scattered around brain
billions receptors. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - think going
general sense? - Yeah, yeah, really area active exploration,
don't great answers. know good amount receptor level
pharmacology, things post-receptor signaling pathways. words, just
fitting receptor. Clearly, serotonin not psychedelic, know? else
tripping, us, time. - 'Cause eat bagel, get serotonin
release, right? - Uh-huh. - mean, there's... turkey. - different LSD.
- mean, tryptophan it, right? - Mm-hmm. - understanding serotonin,
broad strokes, generally leads state fairly, pushes
mind body towards state contentment within - Right. - immediate
experience. Whereas dopamine system really places us external view
world, possible. - Yeah. - fair say? - Need
something. mean, consistent understanding, certainly, not


terms of... don't primarily identify neuroscientist, definitely tell viewers
far domain mine. terms psychedelics
drugs interface neuroscience level. - Well, feel free explain
experiential level. - Yeah. - mean, doesn't have- think probably
audience members interested in, 5-H2C? layer five neurons
cortex? - Yeah. - conversation, hold, interesting
conversation. just terms experience serotonergic versus dopaminergic
drugs, - Right. Yeah. - seem create distinct classes experience. think
appropriate level - Right. - us discuss them. - terms they...
like explore biology little bit here, tell sort known,
ideas are. - [Dr. Huberman] Please. - know, path...
know, levels analysis, not one going on. almost like,
particular question, level analysis appropriate? question best
addressed biology, chemistry, physics? think receptor
level, post-receptor signaling, downstream effects neuro-transmitters,
activation level effects, coordination activation. got the, clearly,
classic psychedelics, two way activation. know
downstream effects

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate

terms increasing glutamate transmission. likely commonality
ketamine psychedelic slightly different way, but- - people hallucinate
ketamine? - Yes, yes, dissociative. someone likely sort
less behaviorally active. really high dose, go K-hole,
go really high dose, like get surgery, - called, - just
unconscious. - K-hole? - Yeah, K-hole. - Not A-hole, K-hole? - K-hole,
yeah [laughs]. - Right. - different. K-hole. ketamine's interesting, 'cause
people can take kind bumps, kind dance sort alcohol level
strength effect, sort classic kind raving use it. folks
want titrate dose, line, get like 75, 100
milligrams, talkin' about, dance floor, floor,
friends trying make sure people aren't steppin' you. like K-
hole- - Yeah, somebody want take dissociative anesthetic? Like, me,


completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

completely mysterious someone want dissociate body. -
People claim NMDA antagonist psychedelics extremely insightful
similar way experiences classic psychedelics. So- - ketamine now
legal therapeutic use, correct? - Right, right. Spravato, intra-nasal form marketed
Janssen, esketamine, one the- - prescription? - Yeah,
prescription- and- - people taking nasal spray? - Yeah. - then,
undergoing talk therapy this? - Typically not.
interesting, much work needs done. not treated
psychedelic therapy, that, psychedelic therapy, mean, tell person
going altered experience. tell pay attention
experience, might learn something experience. afterwards,
discuss experience. Spravato, model is- - Spravato is? - esketamine. -
Okay. - the, yeah, spray form ketamine. FDA-approved treatment
resistant depression. probably feel different. Ignore that. side effect.
[laughs] adverse effect. Just ignore it. don't think anything
way works. just get thing. direct sort chemotherapeutic effect
sense . not facilitating learning process. Now, older work.
guy, Krupitsky, Russia extensive work higher doses ketamine.
say, Spravato, prescribed doses, isn't very... pretty low dose. mild
psychedelic range, not strong. older work happened '90s
early 2000s Russia, using high doses, treating like
psychedelic. know, treating psychedelic therapy. words,
telling people, going experience. going to... hoping
learn something it. going help it. going discuss
afterwards. found incredibly high rates success pretty well
controlled trials heroin addiction alcohol addiction. think whole lot
work needs done now. see ketamine clinics using
ketamine off-label, lot treating like psychedelic therapy. There's,
essentially, no research point that. get better results? Straight use
Spravato, good variability, antidepressant effects last
week, kick immediately. Now, week long time. psychiatric
drugs, take every day, know? - Right. - amazing, still just
week. seeing effects year later psilocybin classic
psychedelics pharmacological difference, get lot


mileage ketamine treated like psychedelic therapy.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides

this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need

psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

00:28:00 Example Psychedelic Experiment

work- - look like? - Really, just like psilocybin
sessions, know haven't described, briefly, anywhere four
eight hours preparation getting know people going guides
therapists room person. - Yeah, maybe walk us
this? say, come one clinical trials, 'cause clinical
trials, right? - Mm-hmm. - lab Hopkins? - Yeah. - need
depressed, just somebody wanted explore psychedelics? -
studies these, - Okay. - number disorders. - Okay. -
healthy, "normal studies", - Okay. - code not problem fix, all...
amazing psychedelics, though, administer
model, develop relationship, give high dose psychedelic,
can healthy normal without diagnosable issue. man, human,
issues seem come surface. - Sure. Yeah- - done work
smoking cessation, people trying quit tobacco, haven't successful. -
variety reasons? - Right. - maybe, just ask simple questions
kind step us process. say sign one
trials, qualified one trials. show up. said, "I several
hours advance getting know team present
psychedelic journey"? - First, screening. kind like couple days
psychiatric, like structured psychiatric interviews whole, past,
symptoms across DSM, psychiatric Bible, see might various
disorders disqualify you, like main ones psychotic disorders,
schizophrenia, also including bipolar. - Right. - manic side bipolar. - Mm-
hmm. - that... also cardiovascular screening, heart disease.
screening, preparation. develop therapeutic rapport people
going room you, guides, also didactically sort
explained psychedelic like, kind laundry list,
known variability going to... not like cocaine.
going feel stimulated. going feel like can any... alcohol,
probably going feel relaxed. like... call 'em uppers, downers,


arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

arounders, psychedelics arounders. like, yeah, be,
beautiful experience life, terrifying experience
life. kind laundry list like things happen, no
surprises. - think important people hear, arounders,
really can't predict somebody going react internally. - Right. - want just
briefly touch something, left topic. occurred me, lot
effects psychedelics, function, et cetera, still mysterious.
recalled mind, prescription antidepressants work also
mysterious. increase serotonin, dopamine, epinephrin, et cetera,
take weeks end, know, several weeks kick in, et cetera, also mysterious.
going back experience coming laboratory. Okay, say
somebody passes prerequisites. day. - Yeah. - Comes day
going experience. eating mushrooms, like hear about,
taking capsule form? sorts doses prescribing?
dose response curve? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - secondary that, like talk
micro dose versus macro dose. - Mm-hmm. - get stuff into...
people receive it, get body? - reive pure
psilocybin. mushroom, many species... People taken
mushrooms United States, likely Psilocybe cubensis. easy
grow. grow cow patties. easy anybody grow 'em closet.
doesn't take 1,000 watt light, like cannabis. takes like little 10 watt light bulb
Tupperware bin. what... types mushrooms people
typically take. not administering those. Psilocybin compound.
draw molecule psilocybin, again, based tryptamine structure, single
molecular entity. white powder. - look like serotonin molecularly? - Yes,
yes, yes. [interposing voices] - show people chemical structure
serotonin chemical structure psilocybin, look quite similar? - Right,
right. [interposing voices] - basically taking serotonin? - modified version
serotonin, makes sense. again, repeated theme chemistry
doesn't always neatly line up, mescaline looks like dopamine
like serotonin, yet, receptor activation level, pharmalogical effect,
similar. yeah, mean, receptor an... hitting
switch, alternate response receptor level. - Yeah, people
don't necessarily understand relationship call ligand, thing


parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -

two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

parks receptor, receptor parking spot, one reasons
can get variety effects different compounds is, instance, serotonin
might affect certain pathway particular rate, psilocybin might trigger
activation different components pathway, different rates, can get
vastly different experiences two things look chemically similar. - Right. -
also good reason people shouldn't just assume can cowboy
chemistry, right? see paper can mix vile often
vastly different predict. - Right. - Right. - dose effect curve
really interesting. early work psilocybin healthy "normals"
looked true placebo, plus four active doses, 5, 10, 20, 30 milligrams
psilocybin. Body weight adjusted, milligrams per 70 kilograms body weight.
recently published paper newer trials dropping body
weight adjustment, 'cause going across hundreds volunteers, kind figured
out, shouldn't really be, don't need adjusting body weight, so- -
Interesting. - yeah. - Well, brain size doesn't vary much individuals. -
Yeah, yeah. - know, end, brain effect, mostly. - Yeah. - Probably
body well. Okay, person ingests powder capsule? - Yeah, little pill. -
Okay. - Yeah. doesn't take- - long it- - 30 milligrams small...
fit tiny, little capsule. it'll take half hour. Well, anywhere
15 minutes hour kick in. average, a- - said, dose range
was? - studies looking want psychedelic effect
20 30 milligram range. Again, adjusted body weight,
average American 70 kilograms, 150 pounds, people, fact, gotten
like 40, 45 lot cases, still small pill. session day not full
of, studies, not full tasks. really want look therapeutic
response. Obviously, therapeutic study, want meaningful experience.
research found, not surprisingly, get less meaningful experience
FMRI, - Right. - ar lot cognitive tasks.
done research type, sure, plenty colleagues have.
therapeutic study, trying understand therapeutic effects,
recognize trade-off can do. typical therapeutic
model, which, again, isn't just limited, necessarily, therapeutic studies
trying treat specific disorder, preparation, person feels
comfortable guides. mean, ultimately, tell people like,


emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion

cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got

know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,

emotional response, welcome. mean, crying like baby
hysterically, like feel like.
lot ways, sometimes people psychedelic experience own, can
harder train model, real world, people psychedelic
experience, lot times, rule hold shit. several friends go party.
split bag mushrooms. like social pressure, good reason, not
guy corner room, everyone's trying just good time
relax, like crying mother. friends,
experience too, drama king, blah-blah-blah, so, yeah,
compose yourself. Hold your- - doing- mean, therapy people.
not just experience? - Right. experience much shaped
container, environment, degree one allows happen.

00:37:30 ‘Letting Go’ Psychedelics

let go control, right? - Yeah, talk letting go control.
march hypothetical experience take place lab.
using sort generic case example, will. letting go control
interesting feature, actually, one common themes good
psychoanalysis, psychotherapy kind, trust built
patient analyst, relationship becomes template trust
generally, trust one's self. actually, end goal good psychoanalysis
patient actually... One end goals develop empathy
themselves, almost sounds like oxymoron, spend little time
statement, actually pans out. psychedelic experience one which,
chemically, new set conditions, right? - Yeah. - coarsely, space
time altered way, sense self. instance, might going
strongly interoceptive mode focusing everything within confines
skin. Whereas, normally, sort interacting space, pens, conversation.
[mumbles] Occasionally, pay attention breathing, sort dilating
contracting focus different things time. - Yeah. - letting go control,
seems, me, sort expansion one perceptual bubble, point
not actually worried perceptual bubble going pop, that,
meaning not worried people think you. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.


not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

not worried whether not brain going explode, even though thought
feel enormous. keep going like this, almost sounds psychedelic, idea
here. paying attention, instance, Somatic experience, like
coursing waves heat body, not suddenly saying, "Is weird?"
actually just going deeper deeper it. it's, essentially, expanding
perceptual phenomenon. convince people go
path? think allows that? think that, me, one
unusual aspects psychedelics, that, normally, social pressure,
also, just internal pressure brain is, pay attention many things
once, not just one. that- - Especially days. Yeah, multi-task. - Exactly. Yeah. -
Right. Multitask. focus one thing, bizarre thing
actually can appear us, right? - Right. - mean, even tip finger,
not taking psychedelics, spend long enough looking tip
finger, will notice - Yeah, weird. - weird things. - Yeah. - Right? -
think classic psychedelic effect, one classic effect, one used
many times, example people necessarily... aren't... One
judicious putting circumstances. Someone
strong psilocybin experience, trying navigate way
Manhattan, crossing street, might staring hand, realize,
like that's, hand amazing miracle. Like entire universe
essentially conspired come one point make absolutely breathtaking...
almost like, think, simplest form of... Well, know simplest form
learning habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli, less response.
organisms do. do. like disc habituation
component that- - Disc habituation? - Yeah, like wouldn't - Yeah. - able get
life, wouldn't able cross street like, whoa,
miracle. know? [laughs] - Well, glad you- No, glad brought up.
mean, here, reflecting bias vision scientist, people don't realize
this, look something long enough, eventually disappears. doesn't
actually disappear, perceptually, disappears. little microsaccades
ensure doesn't. - Right. - us don't look one thing
long. - [Dr. Matthew] Right. - brain's default perceptually jump around like crazy
visual system, auditory system. ADD, people talk ADD lot,
sort baked underlying networks level, can force


attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

attention. sounds like psychedelics, one primary goals therapeutically
really drill one perceptual bubbles, expand bubble.
safety, seems, - Yeah. - safety... sort like permission without
worrying something's going happen. - Right. people
couch... Yeah, remember one lady said, probably 13, 14 years ago, said,
"Matt, tell again, can't die". "I feel like heart going rip chest."
mean, feeling... say, typically, cardiovascular response modest.
pulse blood pressure go somewhat. can dangerous people
severe heart risk, do- - monitoring whole time? - do.
monitor it. - plugged variety devices- - Yeah, every half hour
so, take protocol, space little further, time course,
take blood pressure pulse. goes certain level,
protocol, times, physician comes in,
gives little nitroglycerin tongue, knocks blood pressure
little bit. Doesn't affect experience. place, even though
probably fine, abundance caution. - [Dr. Huberman] Sure. - yeah,
someone can feel that, god, going die. never felt heart beat like
before. experience breath can just absolutely fantastic. sort of...
breath obviously interesting, automatic control, can also
voluntary. people get sense like, god, I... sounds silly, like
stoner movie- - forget breathe? - Exactly. - Yeah. - can
compelling. one the... Get back one questions, like,
kind allow go bubbles? One, wearing eye
shades. don't call 'em blindfolds, 'cause negative connotation, like peakin'
[laughs]. - probably seeing lot anyway. blind isn't
appropriate word it. - Right, right. never thought it. like inner-
sight shades.

00:44:10 Mind’s Eye

[interposing voices] - close eyes, levels activity retina
actually maintained. just spontaneous activity. - seems, curious
thoughts this, mean, way describe it, mind's eye,
kind loose term use, can rocket booster. lot times, people,


like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone
never there. - Right. [interposing voices] will definitely get those.
reason kind cringe, say, "Oh, my", talked those,
knowing little bit pharmacology acetylcholine, idea manipulating
system, me, sounds uncomfortable. whole idea witches
flying, whole history hundreds years ago, so-called witches taking
agents, thinking flying around broomsticks, things
sort. - Yeah. - lot mythology around broomsticks.
complicated. sounds unpleasant. One thing serotonergic,
just, psilocybin, expansion particular, fairly narrow, percept.
sound. - Yeah. - emotion. sadness.
historical event, fear future. - Yes. - mentioned before,
something learned experience. - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - something
going experience undeterred way allows somebody bring
something back standard reality. - Yeah. - Given huge variety
experiences people psychedelics, given huge variety humans
there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -
context laboratory model, think great one, experience will just
valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

like compound like psilocybin, people, no perceptual effect.
looking room, pretty much look same. Sometimes, folks say, "Yeah,
things seem little bit brighter". Now, people will say, "Oh, god,
waves". "That wall waving, curtains..." compounds, people don't
typically see pink elephants. actually get another class. didn't mention
anticholinergic, sort like atropine scopolamine, drugs.
true hallucinations, thought conversation someone

there, now clear therapeutic effects realm depression,
think value going fairly restricted perceptual bubble,
calling, letting go, giving control? experiences many,
value one exports experience kind similar across individuals, -
Yeah. - raises sorts interesting questions. not philosophy
discussion. talking biology psychology here. - Yeah. say,
decide going focus tip pen. mean, psychedelic state,
fall love pen. happen like Pilots V5s [Dr. Matthew laughs]
V7s much. feel real love - Yeah. - pen, right? - Yeah. - not
unreasonable thing expect psychedelic journey. - Right, right. -

valid going experience deep friction might


family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can

one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

family member entire lifespan. - Yeah. - yet, export that,
two vastly different experiences, one feeling better relationship world
one's self. - Right. - tell us about- - can pen, - Right. -
processing childhood trauma lead to- - Right. - Yeah- -
this... mean, level, - Yeah. - raises question, like,

00:48:00 Redefining Sense Self

first all, how, why, mean, just, thoughts that? -
definitely the... terrain figuring out, know? no...
Educated speculation best can provide. think best... think common
denominator persisting changes self-representation. - Okay, tell
self-representation. Yeah. - way one holds sense self, fundamental
relationship person world. mentioned earlier, experience seems
alter models hold reality, think self biggest model,
thing separate things. defined certain... certain
personality, smoker hard time quitting, depressed
person views failure, things, models too.
think change self-representation may endpoint different
experiences. mean, maybe falling love pen, whole idea you're,
especially contemplation afterwards, obviously, speculating here,
whole idea deep connection random, obviously,
random, aspect universe potentially lead transformed understanding
self, pen may proxy miracle reality way relies
nothing on, no supernatural thinking. know, can hard atheist,
take this, know, ultimately, oh, god, like that, just like pen, amazing,
fact exist, extrapolation chair. used
pen, think sounds similar Aldous Huxley's classic description doors
perception chair drapes. took 500 milligrams mescalin,
just like- - high dose mescalin? - Yeah, yeah, heroic dose,
sure. just going off chairiness chair, like chair exuding quality
chair, and- - expansion perceptual bubble? narrow
percept grows within confines narrow percept? - Yeah. - sense
self interesting phenomenon, dissect little bit,


somatic sense self, ability literally feel self. process, call
interoception. title self, blank. - Yeah. -
noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

noticed said several times, intriguing me. good friend, don't
think can mention name, long successful career
within one elite teams within SEAL teams, fairly philosophical
guy, also practical guy, said many times me, powerful
words language "I am", whatever follows tends, repeat
enough, tends kind feedback effect world. first
pass, sounded little bit like, know, kind like internet psychology-type-
thing, like, oh, secret something say, frankly, just not particularly- -
little New Agey. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [mumbles] kind like whole fake till
make it, don't actually subscribe that. - [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh. -
dissecting little bit him, came realize, words, "I am",
powerful. don't think reprogram brain just saying them. one
defines internally, not just people, one psychologically,
default, defines themselves, think, powerful. depressed people, well
happy people, seem define terms categories emotional
states. think interesting, letting go going perceptual bubble,
facilitated by, obviously, really wonderful team therapists, also,
serotonergic agent, - Yeah. - allows us potentially reshape perception self,
tremendous feat neuroplasticity. - Right. think, certainly, work
needs done. horizon. actually credit Chris Letheby, philosopher
Australia, forthcoming book. might right now, soon, within
coming months, "Psychedelics Philosophy". - title book? -
might "Psychedelic Philosophy"? - Okay. - really- - Chris Letheby. put link
it- - Right. conclusion this, really great book, really plays
idea, like, psychedelic experiences come along lot supernatural
stuff, experience. can certainly go along that. idea like, can
experiences, including therapeutic effects, explained naturalist point
view? conclusion that, changes self representation may
commonality. Now, go along plant spirits, Buddha, chakras,
whatever model system, Jesus, that, also completely
devoid supernatural, religious. do, fact, see varieties.
think something change sense self. seems something


identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

identity level, with... think work cancer patients
substantial depression anxiety cancer, also work
people trying quit cigarette smoking. mean, real... seems be,
really works, change people view themselves, like smoking, like
really stepping model like, smoker, tough quit smoking
cigarettes. can't it. failed bunch times. remember one participant
session, held onto afterward, said, "My god, like can really just decide,
like flicking off button, can decide not smoke". call duh experiences
psychedelics, 'cause people often, like cancer stage, say, "I'm causing
suffering". can follow appointments. can everything, can still plan
the... not getting outside sunshine. not playing grandkids.
choosing that. like, told before, smoker
told million times, can... sounds... comes
mouths, folks will say, part ineffability psychedelic experience, folks
say, "I know sounds like bullshit sounds like, god, just sigh",
like feeling gravity agency, think interesting, cause regardless
debates reality freewill, think philosophy that, whether ultimately
free will, like pure agency, exists, skeptical of, just idea,
clearly, sense agency. something there, whether sense
agency even, human has, seems be, times, fundamentally,
supercharged psychedelic experience. idea like, just going make
decision. Like normally, like tell depressed person, don't think way.
not failure. - can't it. [interposing voices] - just, yeah. like- -
Right. - Well- - can, actually, one states, experience
realize, like, god. Just like using MDMA treat PTSD, going
starting work psilocybin treat PTSD, someone really reprocess trauma
way lasting effects. clearly, probably something that...
know, reconsolidation memories, altered, consistent
understanding way memory works. whole idea, people can actually,
hours, profound experience decide make changes
are, sticks, seems something like that. -
profound. mean, think, moments ago, made semi-disparaging
statements things like secret, affirmations, reason
nod fact people putting ideas forward well-intentioned


people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

people, neural networks brain put language last. tell stories,
know? stories powerful. think one cruel aspects
whole self-help literature popular psychology idea, everything say,
brain body hear it. actually unkind even cruel thing people
depressed anxious hear, hear that, believe that, want
clear, don't think true, think hard control thoughts.
hard control thoughts? somebody says, "I can't", somebody says,
"Well, no, every time say can't, brain hears that, reinforces it",
treacherous place live. language powerful, neural networks,
brain, networks underlie emotionality, perception, sense self,
don't change response language. change response experience. -
[Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - just fundamentally, prerequisites. need
certain neuromodulators present, like serotonin dopamine. need
sufficient levels. don't need drug necessarily it. give kid kitten
puppy, first kitten puppy, levels dopamine serotonin, never
measured them, can pretty sure higher baseline,
experience will reshape them, right? - Yeah. - Likewise adult certain
circumstances. think fascinated idea, somatic perceptual
experience, real experience sort describing, - Yeah. -
allows us reshape neural circuitry, feel differently ourselves.
know really tremendous success

00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings Daily Life

many individuals alleviating depression, treating trauma different
compounds. wanted step experience effects psychedelic.
person team, go expanded perceptual bubble.
things go well, able really deep degree. Maybe relived
trauma? Maybe beauty ability connect things world?
want talk transition state, export life,
really power psychedelic seems therapeutic sense,
ability learn, truly learn, experience, learning becomes
default. one doesn't remind themselves, oh, am... know, don't
affirmation, happy person, a... know, always think


Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

Bart Simpson - Right - writing chalkboard. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Yeah. - didn't
work doesn't work stuff too. transition state,
know kind heightened, so-called peak, - Yeah. -
everything seems kind cascading level person just,
can't really turn off point. - Right. - challenging. start
exit effects drug. transition zones, valuable, much like
transition dream waking state valuable? sort
mishmash altered reality new reality. - Right. - guide people
the, tunnel, exit tunnel? - Yeah. say,
need experimentation. Really, clinical model goes back literally
late 1950s, virtually no experimentation on, say, randomized
people to... going talk latter half session, versus not.
Versus write essay session, versus not. Versus
amount integration. [interposing voices] - studies, writing talking
it? - So- called loosey goosey term, integration, us
means, coming back experience, sort five, six hours in,
afternoon, dosed around nine o'clock, like four o'clock so,
just initial, tell us experience. want to... Not unpacking totally,
just kind initially just little bit discussion go home.
little bit that. then, night, homework write something.
bullet points. 20 pages. get everything range. try
not self-critical. not graded. just process, point discussion
next day. write something, come next day one two hour,
depending study, "integration session", basically, discuss experience.
depending study in, like mean for... dealing
cancer, might mean smoking, becoming non smoker?
encourage simply take seriously. think is, again, sort of, one
points antithesis just kind social users use. mean,
written Huston Smith, scholar religion, terms mystical
experiences can happen psychedelics, lot times, attribution
drug effect dismissed. Even one sense one universe,
totally shakes soul, speak, next day, friends like, ah,
dude, screwed up! much acid you! Whoo! know? Like, man, next
time, needed beers bring down. know, like sort


social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

social reinforcement dismissing experience. Oh, god, talking
head, man. Even good natured, dismissal. not like...
want like, tell that. know, crying one point
talking mom. talk that. like? remember
that? [interposing voices] - follow-up, encouraged
life various people life? - Both. explicitly
follow-up, discussions. Depending situation is,
might encourage person kind follow-up. really, basics is,
supportive therapy. non-structured. use reflective listening, sort
humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard person. think,
someone feels inclined apologize sibling things, like, yeah, go
ahead call 'em up. something big, like relationship change, like, sit
two weeks. Don't make big... Don't end relationship. Don't quit job.
Don't make big- - also tell not start relationships? - don't
remember ever coming up. - Interesting. - it- - not joking. just
wondering, know? - Yeah. - makes sense want- - Like
dating, thinking like, ah, might time take next level.
ask girl marry me? come up, say too, don't sit
week two? - Yeah, don't get puppy. - let sober mind- - Don't get
puppy.

01:04:36 Flashbacks

Certainly, don't get four puppies your... [Dr. Matthew laughs] question
flashbacks. - Uh-huh. - know, one kind things hear flashbacks,
people- - Yeah. - people get flashbacks? so, basis
flashbacks? on-the-street lore this, that, somehow, compound
gets stored body fat tissues, released later. Like, complete nonsense?
- No evidence that, probably complete nonsense. - Flashbacks nonsense,
storage body fat complete nonsense? - storage body fat. answer
whether flashbacks complete nonsense, define it. really think
multiple constructs going. not thing fall term.
phenomenon appears real, called hallucinogen-persisting
perceptual disorder. DSM. certain number people, small number


people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

people percentage-wise used psychedelics, will persisting
perceptual disorders, like see halos around things. see trails, like
image following object motion. see distortions color. it'll
like anything else disorder DSM. clinically distressing,
persisting number months. rare, mysterious.
keys are, amazingly, never seen thousands
participants, either older era, late '50s early '70s, people
psychedelic studies LSD, psilocybin, mescalin, never seen
Modern Era, again, now thousands participants number centers like
throughout world. seems something is, reason, happening
illicit use. now brings in, okay, polypharmacology? - Right. - know,
'cause drinking- - take thought took? - Yeah.
dose? purity? - Yeah. - also, think actually even so,
likely going on, sort rare neurological susceptibility.
one paper case series individuals reporting symptoms, didn't
limit just people hallucinogen history. amazing thing
this, number people seem straight HPPD diagnosis. -
HPPD? - Hallucinogen-persisting perceptual disorder, never taken
psychedelic. often prompted alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, even
tobacco. believe, one individual, no lifetime history any, wasn't proceeded
substance uses. think it's... think like precipitation
exacerbation psychotic disorders. seems pretty clear observation
people either predisposition active psychotic disease, can destabilize
them. - Yeah. - psychedelic- way life experience can destabilize -
Sure. - person easily. think like that. probably pretty rare
neurological susceptibility. tended, goes back '80s, clinical practice,
ended DSM focused hallucinogen, relate psychology
xenophobia. always weird thing gets attribution. don't attribute
thing, like, oh yeah. smoke cigarettes? drink? like, well, yeah,
see lots people drinking, not ending this. take crazy drug,
can get people believe sorts crazy stuff. biggest example
cathinone derivatives, so-called bath salts. remember, several years back, -
Oh, yeah. deal that? - guy Florida ate guy's face.
homeless guy literally ate part someone's face off. Yeah, one


crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

crazies- - person alive? - person alive. took
one sheriff's deputy say, "Well, don't know, bet bath salt
stuff going on". thing- - it? - [Dr. Matthew] thing
system- - Well, maybe can set record straight people. this...
say bath salts, bath salts? - wasn't. thing
tox cannabis, know, typically, people don't eat people's faces off
get stoned. - makes hungrier, not hungry. - [laughs] Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. - Right. just example xenophobia. Today, get Google
Images, look bath salts, one common images see poor
guy's face eaten off. just ready latch on. Just like people
another culture don't know, easy assign attribution class
unfamiliar with. think they, psychedelics, got attribution
rare neurological susceptibility, way alcohol didn't. think not specific
psychedelics, don't really know. look it, research
never seen example it. flashbacks can mean number things. think
common thing people experiences is, call, state-dependent learning.
returning similar context can bring back thoughts
emotions experience. someone used mushrooms week ago, now
something like smoked cannabis, take warm bath, simply
relaxed, seems come blue, sudden, these, follow
thought trail takes them, reminds their, find
experience again, think state-dependent learning. not
distressing component in, typically not perceptual. another class
just sort perceptual anomalies within day two following experience,
not HPPD. people joked free trip. Like might see
trails halos day afterwards. doesn't last longer that. doesn't screw
up. kind fun, like, "Oh yeah, still seeing trip", people will say.
mean things. - Got it. - flashback is... Yeah- - Interesting.
No, appreciate clarifying that. mean, one common misconception
neuroplasticity event. not event, process. no
understanding duration process. However, experience drug
life experience, right? Even trauma, wonderful experience,
psychedelic experience, doesn't matter, sets motion series dominoes fall,
falling dominoes call neuroplasticity. mean, reshaping


neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

neural circuits take years. don't know. trigger,
actual change. think described be, literally,
reordering circuitry,

01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing

individuals, might extend longer others. one phenomenon
told people experience, wondering whether not
patients worked with, people trials ever reported this? never
done ayahuasca, assuming overlap serotonin system.
Probably hits variety systems. - DMT, active- - Right. - orally- - Excuse
me, right. - NAO inhibitors - course. course. - allow - Yeah. -
DMT orally- - Right, should've recalled that. Absolutely. Well, never done it,
number people know done ayahuasca, well people know
who've done MDMA, report increased sense sometimes called ASMR,
autonomic sensory meridian reflexes, is... interesting, lot people
naturally, hide these. actually something many people keep
hidden themselves. just ask you, can it. people able pass
like shiver spine, spine, consciously. know, like can kind
of. able actually pass shiver spine. actually learned
kid hot day. standing field sports camp. like, really hot
here. actually create like cooling, cooled perception. - Yeah. - told
someone once, led discussion of, oh, can it, always hid
people, 'cause actually somewhat pleasurable. well-known
phenomenon, ASMR. [Dr. Matthew laughs] people know taken
MDMA therapeutically, ayahuasca, will report feel great relief this.
can generate autonomic reflexes body readily. Probably,
guessing, able tune kind deeper sense somatic self.
Now, internet, ASMR, look up, little bit like bath salt thing,
direction. Like people pay... just say, accounts
YouTube many, many millions viewers people will whisper
about... Like, instance, people will go listen to, seems
women particular, whispering like car mechanics, something, scratching.
certain sounds will this. Whispering, tapping, finger tapping.


people experience immense pleasure it. not really sexual pleasure,
kind deep core body. - Yeah. - autonomic nervous system
curve spine. - Probably certain number people call Kundalini,
another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later
feeling perception self outside head. - Ah! - literally...
uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic
phenomenon. - studies done? - No. - imagine, person might
actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -
could- - right. - Yeah, body clear, - Right. Right. -
projection - Yeah. - wouldn't? - Yeah, sense self, mean, well-known
phenomenon. individuals, sad, people actually avidly seek
amputation limbs, limbs, feel, don't belong body. - Oh,
yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.
Anyway, think core conversation drilling is, notion
reordering self. relief know flashbacks not something
kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,

another one- - Right. - Scientifically who'd... Yeah. - right. - Yeah. -
People long duration Kundalini breathing sessions, many will report later

uncomfortable them. feel like walking around
sense self extended beyond body. clinically described neurologic

actually like... duck? - Oh, what- - they're- interesting
experiment- - kind thing lab want get into. -

yeah. Yep. - sad, fortunately, rare, also sad condition.

kind of, forgive term [chuckles],

01:15:54 MDMA, DMT

baked psychedelic experience. suppose, good segue ask
sorts drugs. said, "baked in", temptation go marijuana
cannabis. - Yeah [laughs]. - could, like just ask
dopaminergic compounds. particular, MDMA. - Yeah. - understanding,
MDMA purely synthetic compound, not going find MDMA nature. -
far. - far. - certain- DMT first synthesized lab,
thought didn't exist nature, Richard Schultes found everywhere [laughs]
South America. - Yeah, actually- Yeah- - knows, plant - Right. -
might making MDMA. - Right. Right. - far know now, no. - Right.
talk DMT sources within body. MDMA exist
elsewhere, synthesized. understanding, MDMA leads
robust increases dopamine serotonin simultaneously, which, neural


networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute
effects, may play role in... less sort control amygdala,
terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA

networks perspective, unusual situation, right? Normally, dopamine
puts us exteroceptive, looking outside ourselves, seeking things world
beyond skin, skin, dopamine, excuse me, serotonin tends focus us
inward. almost mutually exclusive - Yeah. - kind neurochemical states,
always - Yeah. - different levels. be, increased
dopamine increased serotonin provide experience beneficial?
you, extent can describe it, think experience
differs sorts experiences people psilocybin serotonergic
agents, just broadly speaking? - Yeah, yeah. terms effects, generally,
serotonin dopamine, can speculate sort of, dopaminergic component
necessary for... say, know amygdala less reactive acute

terms one's experience memory, may part sort reprocessing,
reconsolidation memories different way, amygdala not like
going crazy, saying, freak out, like fight flight. - said, seems like
MDMA used clinically, anyway, mainly trauma, - Right. - not just
depression, sorry. - Although part that, really don't know, maybe MDMA
great depression, other. may that, going
looking soon, psilocybin great treating PTSD. lot underground
therapists say that, underground psychedelic therapists. don't really know yet- -
mean underground? Oh, it- - People illegal,
- Yeah. - like professional therapist would. just illegal. kind
growing thing. don't really know which. Speculating, may MDMA,
broader number people, better trauma, chances
extremely challenging experience, call bad trip, like really freaking out,
much lower MDMA. People can bad trips, different nature.
not- - Well, is- - not sort like freaking out, reality sort
shattering, less this. can take many forms classic psychedelics,
typically, hear something like, didn't know going like this. No
matter hard tried prepare them, like is... Like get off this- -
talking LSD psilocybin? - LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca. - Bad trip. - Yeah, yeah.
just sense like, going insane. far beyond anything ever
experienced, scaring shit me. - often happen? - don't
toehold anything, - Yeah. - even exist entity, can


really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going
black box, terms operant behavior within choosing
handle letting go, know? eventually, able see real time
brain imaging. Ah, there, surrendering psychedelic experience. Here,
trying hold on. not yet. think clinical
observation, seems pretty clear something like going on. certain drugs,
like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can
extraordinary, even compared others, 'cause forces people. no choice
hang out. - never done it. - Yeah. - told DMT like high-speed
locomotive psychedelic experience, psychedelic experience, - [Dr.
Matthew] Yeah. - no ability hold onto self kind
peak phase. correct? - lot people say that. Terence McKenna, kind
classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,
Languages totally deficient describe experience anyway, much less
psychedelic. McKenna's background? qualification this,
referred, bard DMT psychedelics? - talking Terrence,
also brother, Dennis, know, whose- - Can imagine
Thanksgiving dinner - Yeah, brothers. - like house. - Terence passed
away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

really... think, frankly, experientially, kind gateway
transcendental mystical experiences, sense unity things, know
data suggests related long-term positive outcomes. - Wait, want make sure
understand. saying, bad trip can related transcendental
experience? - Right, think both, speculating, pass
sort like reality shattering, including sense self, one can handle
one two ways. can either completely surrender it, can try hang on,
try hang on, going like bad trip. again, wish
more, hopefully, will more, experimentation. lot going

like DMT, smoked DMT, can strong. reason think can

classic bard DMT effects, say, "The sense self intact,
everything else, sensorium, navigated, oriented towards,
everything else changed, basically". hard to... everything's changing,
hard say like, self changing? rest world? - Well,

away years, couple decades ago now. sort one known
bard, can find hundreds, not thousands, hours lecture circuit
'80s '90s YouTube. background really... Oh gosh, don't recall
college degree in. basically, 19, traveled South
America, actually, initial trip, brother, even younger


him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

him, friends, just search DMT snuff read
Harvard archives work Schultes generation before.
discovered mushrooms growing there, psilocybin mushrooms,
recognized, just took lot mushrooms, and- - talked it? - Talked
it. Terence basically intelligent, well-read literature
culture person could... sort next generation's Tim Leary, someone
really speak, get little closer magnitude psychedelic
experience like people. serves, like Leary, somewhat advocate.
mean, tell people, folks, see equivalent UFO landing
White House lawn. Like, right there. It'll take five minutes. It'll shake everything
reality. know, sort goad people it. - Well, certainly,
science clinical medicine is, just two lenses explore
things life. Well, part reason ask is, feel like, world health fitness,
extreme condition like Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodybuilders
2% body fat, look like, people, look kind freakish, -
Yeah especially now, right? - Oh, especially now. - Especially now. - Yeah, yeah. -
yeah- - Made Arnold look - Yeah, yeah. - like regular- - Exactly. - Back day, yeah. -
Yeah. contortionists can put small box wrap
pretzel. two extreme subculture practices that,
don't know anything contortionism, really, except get really bendy,
community included lifestyle practices, nutritional practices,
drug practices. extreme subcultures, export,
weight training healthy, right? general public done that. yoga
healthy. - Yeah. - contortionism yoga, et cetera. feel like similar thing
happening realm psychedelics, Leary Huxley. Look,
Bay Area. not far Midland Park VA, "One Flew
Cuckoo's" basically, based on, right? - Oh, yeah. - Ken Kesey guys.
attempt creating movement toward openness psychedelics
positive effects. happened before. - Yeah. - difference is,
now, people like inside walls university, publishing peer-
reviewed studies, things sort.

01:26:00 Dangers Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis



reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

reason asked McKenna was, seems like McKenna brother
just two many people, Michael Pollan, et cetera, no real formal training
biology psychology. guys universities lost jobs.
actually removed places like Harvard universities kind cavalier
explorations. Right? - Oh, yeah, mm-hmm. - now, things kind returning.
way bodybuilding led weight training every corner gym, - Yeah. -
men, women, children, contortionism one extreme, people generally think
yoga pretty healthy practice, right? matter degrees, right?
now, - Yeah. - inside walls highly respected university, Johns
Hopkins. medical school side, - Mm-hmm. - undergrad? -
med school, - Medical. - serious health institution. question me,
valuable exports, right? extreme lie? mean, clearly,
problem tinkering reality pharmacology, benefit,
sounds like, tinkering reality pharmacology. - Yeah. -
striking me, elements atypical experience, atypical representation self.
average person, right? kids hearing this. Kids
teens, right? - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - want talk about, dangers
psychedelics? something don't hear lot days, not
anti-psychedelic all, dangers, right? kid adult
predisposition toward, say, psychotic thinking, right? auditory hallucinations? -
Yeah. - Whereas Asperger's side autism spectrum, increased
risk bringing mind states? 'Cause sounds like labile situation.
talk little bit that? classes different drugs,
whether not MDMA, LSD, DMT, think particularly sharp blades,
therefore need wielded particularly carefully? - Yeah. can
profoundly de-stabilizing experiences, ones that, ideally, safe container,
sort someone... relevant dangers, can mitigate
those? two biggies. One, already mentioned, people
severe psychiatric illness. Not depression, not anxiety. talking psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia, mania part bipolar disorder. diagnostically,
shifted. little hard say many people today bipolar
labeled schizophrenia back '60s early research just
clinical observation done. seems clear folks predisposition
active disease, destabilized. cases know of,


always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't

going treating you, be, anyone else United States,

study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies

look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work

growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now

just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,

always think Syd Barrett, first singer Pink Floyd, seems pretty clear. Although,
think family- - don't know happened there. - he- - be... Sorry, Pink
Floyd fans. never... songs just really long. - Yeah, punk
guy, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. [both laughing] got foot lot worlds, definitely
part Floyd world. basically went crazy early on. don't think family
ever admitted it, developed schizophrenia, classic pattern, lot
LSD. like lot cases, looked like showing signs of,
hints susceptibility before. often, hard disentangle
causes what, people, typically, not always, develop?
modal period first break? adolescence, early adulthood. Yeah.
people start playing drugs? [laughs] exact time period, can hard
disentangle. seems pretty clear. Now, also say, cases folks
schizophrenia say psychedelics helped them. anecdotes
everything, though. big world. - people around schizophrenics say
helped them, just- - don't know. - 'Cause schizophrenics say things,
to- - weight it. - mean, due compassion respect
schizophrenia, disorder thinking. saying, helped them? - Yeah, can
trust them? Yeah. wouldn't surprised kernel truth
cases, just so... seems clear side too,
ever therapeutic potential disorders, shouldn't
first thing list, need learn lot more, level risk,
start research see psilocybin can help schizophrenia. don't think...
[Dr. Huberman mumbles] may never case, even is,
even cautious figure things first
disorders. - bipolar? - 'Cause seems- - Bipolar disorder, can
exacerbated compounds? - Yeah, it's- may that, sort
manifestation people prolonged psychiatric issues psychedelic
experience, atypical is, happens, may might
like manic episode psychotic episode, can blurry line. folklore
that, people go trip, never come back. clearly not case,
drug metabolized, like anyone else, next day, virtually
nothing- - reshapes circuitry. mean- - Right. really think, much like
positive long-term effects class problems related to, experience
destabilization can happen experience, not right container.


again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

again, people susceptible to... know, people psychotic
predisposition, lucky born great family, stable environment. maybe
never full break, one not nearly bad someone
homeless, coming kinds early childhood trauma. disease
probably going far worse. psychedelic experience like one de-
stabilizing experiences. Now, fortunately, really easy identify people.
even err side extreme caution eliminating people like, say, first
degree relative. studies, even second degree relative. Given heritability,
increased chance - Sure. - brother your... Yeah.
abundance caution, even eliminating that... think, eventually, approved use,
FDA use, dial back learn more. think, it's, again, overly
cautious, is- - early stage clinical trial, so. - Yeah,
appropriate place start point time. give SCID, another
structured psychiatric interview clinician, sitting person
hours delve history, like reliably determine person
either psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, strong predisposition. can
screen that, address that. far likely danger bad
trip. Anyone can this. psychologically healthy person world,
probably. jack dose high enough, especially less ideal
environment, can bad trip. even get ideal environment like
high dose around 30 milligrams psilocybin. best preparation can
provide, third people will say, essentially, point, bad trip,
we'd- - point within entire journey. - Right. - Yeah. - Now,
one beautiful experiences life, sometimes, like couple
minutes later. - Right. - point, sense strong anxiety, fear,
losing mind, feeling trapped, something like that. Now, typically, people
that, just taken own, like lot things, fine. get
it. likely better off not navigate streets
Manhattan. people, friends, better friends
aren't also dealing psychedelic experience. probably
friend type, [mumbles] better nothing. dependent
context. tough thing conveying public that, lot folks
will say, man, taken psychedelics hundreds times, like fear-
mongering, no, exaggerating danger there. want say,


atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

atypical, sometimes, file folder grows larger every year
cases, either medical literature news, people freak
psychedelic, get hurt die. run traffic. fall height.
Whether thought fly, whether just fell, like can
drunk intoxicated substance. Sometimes unclear. gosh,
one craziest cases kid, like 18-year-old so, Oregon, several years
back, just... even wrote about, want take biggest... done
mushrooms before. want take heroic dose. biggest dose ever taken.
ended just totally it. Ended neighbor's house. just totally
disoriented, disconnected reality, cops ended killing him,
just tragic. Obviously, overuse force case, 'cause actually naked
time. naked like 120 pounds, think, recall, kid ended dying. But- -
Well, analogous reason used examples bodybuilding culture. mean,
people taken excessive amounts anabolic diuretics, died.
contortionist culture, people put little plexiglass boxes
do... extremes, going get deaths, extremes - Right. - one
extremes sheer number people different biological makeups taking
drug. can create extremes numbers. create
extremes dosage, right? seems. - Right. - Well, fan
fact people like clinical trials inside walls universities.
Not think psychedelics utility environments,
important toward creating transition legality, understand
legality means compound like this, right? - Right. model. Yeah. - Right,
mean, again, stay anabolic steroids. now testosterone
estrogen replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy common medically
approved practice, vastly different people taking stuff,
deciding much need take, right? Like said, yoga,
contortionism plexiglass box, thinking Houdini, - Right.

01:38:15 Micro-Dosing

- something. matter degrees. Speaking dosage, definitely want
ask microdose versus standard macrodose. Tell wrong,
always little bit, micro-cynical, will, term microdose. reason


is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

is, many people know talk microdosing taking dosages
compounds work powerful microgram levels. word micro,
think, can little bit confusing people, microdose implies less
something. - Yeah. - mini dose, right? yet, compounds
tremendously powerful microgram concentrations. constitutes microdose,
value so-called microdosing, any, differ
standard, can assume called macrodosing? - Yeah. LSD
prototypical example super potent compound. - Yeah, much I-
size dosage LSD will lead hallucinations, kind standard- - sort
entry point psychedelic-type effects, may not involve hallucination...
Actually, classic psychedelics don't lead true hallucinations, defined
psychiatry. Again, thinking talking person not there, seeing pink
elephant. pseudo hallucinations- - like tracers things like that. - Right. -
Perceptual blending. - Yet, people never get that, even high dose.
think broadly, terms psychedelic effects, isn't just perceptual, unless
get level, alluding earlier, broader definition perception,
like one's models world, model self. can consider
perception, terms truly not sensation, perception, construction putting
together reality. yeah, yeah, yeah. psychedelic effects typically
considered start LSD around 100 micrograms. 10th milligram 100
micrograms. - Right. someone taking 100 micrograms LSD, nowadays, people
might mistakenly refer microdose, micrograms,
actually macrodose LSD? - Right, might, one common
mistakes situations people get microdosing, intend
microdose, ends full-blown dose. Now, people do, working
LSD, microdosing, shoot something like, say, 10 milligrams,
something range, 10, 20 milligrams LSD. 10th, 5th, something kind
entry level psychedelic dose. People's ability street this, say
street corner, anyway, like outside medical profession
this, varies, can imagine. - not measuring purity molarity, -
Yeah. - things like that, typically. - ways it. even don't
ultimately know dose blotter paper acid, one least get sense
like, yeah, one tabs is, one hits psychedelic experience.
something like put water. 100% aqueous soluble.


make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

make sure gets solution, volumetrically measure. going
homogeneously distributed, can take 1/10 volume water
fully dissolved, whatever started with, going 10th dose.
people sophisticated will things like that.
working mushrooms, grow bunch mushrooms, say, put
coffee grinder. not telling people this, way. just describing.
don't home. grind homogenous. 'Cause can like
sort taking two caps stem, hey, two caps stem buddy takes
different potency two caps stem buddy takes.
people kind know will grind homogenous powder,
pack whatever size capsule, know that... again, even
don't have... Sometimes, might buddy that'll sneak HPLC
job whatever, happen well connected. - Not lab- - Not lab!
never happened. Seriously, never happened. least know that, hey,
got sense two capsules do. got sense five capsules do.
reality, not people do. take piece blotter paper, get
tiny, little pair scissors, Swiss Army Knife pair scissors, cut tab
acid, like quarter inch square something, cut 10 little
pieces, like, - Right. - no idea equally distributed media. -
Yeah, can chuckle it. me, one reasons experiment
around psychedelics, cultural experiment, legal experiment, seeing
now, attempted '60s '70s. difference was,
street. people universities dabbling stuff,
'em lost jobs, asked leave through... - lost funding
research, minimally, [interposing voices] - right. - move
topics - right. - career. - precarious times.
key moment, everyone assumes going legal years.
think premature assumption, frankly. - Yeah. - touch
legality, things happening now. microdosing
psilocybin versus sorts dosages described 10 40
milligram range? heard people taking one two milligrams psilocybin every
day way to, quote/unquote, listening, just making air quotes
fingers, "increase plasticity", term personally loathe,
mean? mean, don't really want brain plastic,


need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

need maintain ability make predictions. - balance. - Yeah, plasticity- -
Order chaos. need models world. need heuristics, like- - Plasticity
never goal, it, plasticity never goal. - end goal. - Goal directed
plasticity goal, right? - Right. Right. - Learning language, reshaping
experience trauma, altering perception self. plasticity process. a- -
Yeah, schizophrenia lot plasticity. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - Exactly. Right, right.
might even be, one theory extreme ongoing plasticity,
people never create stable representations anything. kind minority view
there. business microdosing, clinical evidence,
peer-reviewed published evidence works, quote/unquote, "to make people feel
better anything"? - microdosing aim taking something around
10th sort entry-level psychedelic dose whatever compound.
like, yeah, psilocybin, usually people, almost never people like pure
psilocybin. One milligram psilocybin range microdose. likely,
people going mushrooms, something like half gram mushroom,
quarter gram. - know people every day. every
day. - Right. - like their... way take, personally, not
recommending people this, take some... fan LCL-carnitine lately.
kind - Yeah. - experimenting little bit, not psychedelic
compound. take every day, - Right. - taking psilocybin every day. -
supplement. - supplement. - Yeah. - So- - yeah, claims
are, number them, two general ones. One, sort acting
place ADHD treating drugs. psychomotor stimulant, like better version
Adderall. claims are, essentially, better version traditional
antidepressants, better version Prozac, know, so- - people taking
attention deficit depression? - Yeah, aspects disorders
degree of. Just like amphetamine going increase focus,
right dose, anyone takes amphetamine, pretty much, whether ADHD
diagnosed not. idea that, may not be, necessarily, clear divide
therapeutic need positive psychology, even improving mood focus,
not necessarily correcting ADHD, improving focus supercharge life.
claims. am... none peer-reviewed studies are, much
credibility, none shown benefit, tried. only,
point, four five studies that... think things like this, really need double


blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

blind research, 'cause effects... mean, one study done Amsterdam
people knew taking psilocybin truffles, basically mushrooms,
like roots mycelia. - Microdosing them? - Well, taking
considered microdose, cognitive measures after.
types things that, like lot cognitive measures measured on, order
reaction time milliseconds. types effects get, imagine,
ones like be, totally expect either
practice effect expectancy effect, placebo effect. something like
claimed, imagine, sort increased focus, enhancement cognition.
going subtle effects really need good placebo control
for. handful studies done shown, ranged finding
no effect whatsoever just little bit impairment, like impairing someone's ability
time estimation production tasks. want accurate sense time, least
navigating real world. different couch heroic dose
therapeutic reasons safe, crossing street, you're...
work life- - function world. - Yeah, way people
claiming use that. helps better CEO. want accurate sense time.
anything data suggests makes little bit less accurate,
evidence someone feels little bit impaired, feel little bit high.
terms of... call abuse liability research. Not surprising, take little bit
drug can result type high, take little, tiny bit it, feel
little bit high. none the... far, no studies shown increase creativity,
enhancement form cognition, sustained improvement mood. Now, no
studies actually looked system microdosing aficionados
claiming, couple models there. folks like Paul Stamets,
others, particular formulas. like, need take one day,
take many days off, take every four days. don't want get
whose model what, always something like that, pattern use, usually
not every day. claim that, not just... know, sometimes people get
benefit first time take it, really say, need
while. Like weeks in, may start notice pattern using it,
feeling benefits off days, like three two days
active doses. claims. Again, don't know truth
working, studies not done model that. big caveat. We,


field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,

field, say, "we", scientific field, not done studies really model
real aficionados claiming therapeutic benefits come from. said,
almost assuredly good amount placebo there. caveat
like, almost everything medicine therapeutics, going degree
placebo there. - Sure. Belief effects are... colleague Stanford, Alia Crum,
published really beautiful work belief effects, show that, essentially, give
milkshake two people, two groups people. tell one
contains lot nutrients. low calorie shake. insulin response -
Amazing. Yeah. - varies dramatically two. two groups, rather,
equivalent amounts physical movement, tell one group going
good them, help lose weight, lose, average, 8 12 pounds
exact patterns movement. - Amazing. - think
belief effects boil sorts kind network-wide neuromodulation, things
sort, but- - work Harvard suggesting, even don't
deception, give placebo, say, sugar pill, - Right. - tell that, -
Right. - still treat things. think irritable bowel - Right. - first thing
looked at. - Right. - huge... reality there. - Right. -
necessity developing drugs make sure not that. actual
practice medicine, hopefully, always getting underlying direct
efficacy plus placebo enhances that. - Right. - Now, is...
real question is, microdosing, claims 100% placebo, part
placebo, part "real", quote/unquote, effect? bet is, totally based
anecdotes, think probably reality antidepressant effects. find
intriguing, - Well- - suffering depression. - Right. - Even
a... wouldn't interesting as, think, high dose psilocybin
psychedelics treat depression. be... developed, reality,
like better, perhaps, better SSRI, better Prozac. -
similar. - said, need tools fewer tools toolbox. -
Right. - shouldn't surprise. Like even before, going back tricyclics,
MAO inhibitors, going back '50s, like augmenting extracellular serotonin
one way another, many people, leads reduction depressive symptoms.
wouldn't crazy chronically stimulating subtype serotonin receptor
antidepressant effect. think, put bets it, anything
real, category. Although, open like, maybe something


creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

creativity, improved cognition, covers many domains itself.
greatest hopes antidepressant effects. said, big picture, think
interesting thing psychedelics heroic doses. mean, idea
can give something one, two, three times, see improvements depression
months later, - Right. - addiction year later, these, people dealing
potentially terminal illness, mean, interested big effects. - [Dr. Huberman]
Right. - don't think ever going get really big effects. also
concern almost common psych, common psychedelics, even
counting MDMA, serotonin agonist effects, agonizing serotonin 2B
shown lead heart valve formation problems, morphology issues,
valvulopathy. fen-phen pulled market. - diet drug? -
Yes. - effective diet drug. - Right, right. portion combination
serotonin 2B activity problem. don't know...
toxicologists ever spoken say, cardiologists say, like,
look, hey, concern there, not applicable whole idea
taking something times therapeutically within lifetime. idea taking
something twice week years... mean, even hippies back '60s weren't
that, right? not even these... even heart valve
disease problem stemmed psychedelic use, connecting dots?
not showing clinical charts anyone figure out. just
theoretically, concern, something's going happen heart
valves, likely issues arise someone's taking things,
like, yeah, say, twice week next five years. want throw
people really consider. - Right, yeah. something hadn't heard before.
micro sounds safer, microdosing, opposed heroic macrodosing, yet,
unless... context lab, labs similar work, got
this, people checking blood pressure. got people really monitoring
psychological physical safety. people microdosing, sounds like
potential, either serotonin 5H2B receptor, mechanism,
maybe common

01:56:45 Risks Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials

cumulative negative effects, think really important consideration.


glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

glad brought up. kids? brain plastic early life.
becomes less plastic age. - Yeah. - Although, maintains degree
plasticity throughout lifespan. year 25, not year 25, rather, age 25
years, sort inflection point rigidity nervous system seems
really take off. course, people don't wake 25th birthday, find
no neural plasticity, whereas day before, lot. plus minus, - Yeah. -
whatever is, year two, depends individual. However, young brain
plastic, imagine, great risks, knows, maybe even
benefits, certainly not thinking those. mainly thinking risks
young people taking psychedelics. trials looking people... clinical
trials, age 18, anyone explored rigorous way,
given potential exacerbate psychotic symptoms bipolar symptoms
people? heightened risk that? story age use
psychedelics therapeutic purposes? - no formal research. Although,
high chance will be. one interesting things folks
may not realize appreciate FDA approval process. FDA already,
multiple instances, signaled want see studies. - Before? - Well, not
approved necessarily adults, going eventually want
see... fact, MAPS group developing MDMA PTSD, already
signaled kind list interest. even incentives
FDA pathways incentivizing folks explore use young people. know
work helped pushing psilocybin phase 2B clinical research,
FDA said, "Well can't give kids?" like, aware depression
problem adolescents? really interesting, FDA
concerned pseudo-specificity. idea that- - Wait, define pseudo-
specificity? - put drug, say, oh, good men, not women.
good black folks, not white folks. now, sometimes, good
rationale that, like talking hormones, specific, men
versus women, certain issues, certain disease states, like maybe sickle cell
anemia, relevant. - Tay-Sachs, things like that. Sure. - Yeah, exactly.
absent something that, concerned saying, oh, type
person, not type person. age one things. also,
recognition, much like emphasis NIH rodent studies human studies,
can't just say, "You're studying men". need rationale, [mumbles].


- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

- Yeah, clear people, there's... recent switch, stipulation
every federally funded grant sexes, don't refer gender scientific
studies, unless study gender, per se. refer sex, meaning biological sex,
stipulation, order receive continue receive funding,
studies males females species, including humans. -
least, even not powered it, least looking exploratory analysis.
Like grant reviewer, charged looking at, address sex
biologically relevant variable anyway? - Right. same- - just throw
there- - drug different effects males versus females? - Right.
least look trends, even again, underpowered look
subject-type effects. - great shift didn't exist 10 years ago. -
Right. - sounds like grants panels. study section members, didn't
that. Now, important biological variable. don't look that, you,
essentially, won't get funding. - age similar thing. whole idea, like,
man, something help kids, rationale? think going be...
Now, obviously, going studies least just much, probably
more, more, cautionary approach. probably going be...
certainly, whatever disease states looked at, going probably
treatment resistant, least first step. know, hey, kids tried- - Suicidal
depression? - Yeah, yeah. mix. hey, stuff really helps
people 25 30, rationale won't help younger person?
generic kind concerns about, developing nervous system,
susceptible to... mean, cuts ways, 'cause also "plastic" generally -
Yeah. - adaptable, maybe resilient injury certain ways. hear
rhetoric kids, brains, drugs, like developing brain special
concern. yeah. think going seeing research eventually. -
interesting. went high school infamous, sadly, Gunn High School,
highest degree, least one point, highest suicide rate. - Wow. -
large number suicides. written "Times" elsewhere. -
academically successful school? - academically- - lot high
pressure kind of- - Yeah, academically - demanding school, - Yeah. - point
restricted... kids will meet often 6:30 6:00 school
study groups things sort. may relate that.
say, even prior academic pressure, went there, pressure wasn't


like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea
kids prescribed, want emphasize prescribed, not just using, prescribed
psychedelics therapeutic purposes, think might make people balk,
idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

like that. unusual number suicides whatever reason, idea

idea kids killing also make people balk. relieved hear
going

02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation

rational, scientific, safe clinical trial-based exploration this. want ask
current status drugs compounds. pretty active social media,
Instagram Twitter. Twitter little bit
recently, noticed lot dialogue around account
people's accounts around couple themes related psychedelics. First all,
status transition legality prescription purposes? medical doctors,
MDs, prescribing legally therapeutic purposes. first question. second
question is, status relates possession criminal charges?
long time, lived Oakland, one day told not long ago, now,
quote/unquote, "decriminalized" told. Double check, people. - right. -
mean? issue, third question, can
parse one one, issue of, just say, aware lot investor
dollars going companies are, essentially, companies focused psychedelics
therapeutics, psychedelics generally. assume investing
anticipation shift legal status. lot interest now, like will
psilocybin become taxable thing, just like marijuana? start question
like, going US legally? illegal possess, sell, use
compounds? understanding is, can still go jail compounds
possession, selling. - Right. even though legal landscape
different cannabis, similarities. one similarities is,
regardless local, municipal, whether city state decriminalized,
word can mean many things. forms decriminalization close folks
call legalization, others pretty weak, just saying. suggest
police make lowest law enforcement priority, type thing. [interposing voices] -
Turn cheek kind thing. - Right. even cops can still choose to- -
someone get pulled one thing, searched, definition,


illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

illegal, find it, - Right. - have- - are- -
something it. - that'll probably determined judicial precedent,
going thrown out, just local prosecutor, even before, going
choose, even post-arrest, going pursue really go charges, make
charges stick? think still play, going depend
municipality. like cannabis, federally, Schedule compounds. -
means illegal? - means illegal. caveat that, just always
case since Prop 215 California cannabis '96, that, hey, 99% drug
enforcement done local state level. DEA, federal level
law enforcement, tiny fraction arrests. mean, people arrested
drug done local state level authorities, still technically illegal.
can, potentially, depending ambiguity local law,
even local officials charge federal crime. theoretically,
feds always come in. Now, although you'll... Again, similar case whole
cannabis history. feds came early days, folks were, basically,
highly visible, went Tommy Chong selling bongs. remember
"The Tonight Show" one time, think back Jay Leno days. says,
"But along Santa Monica boardwalk every shop sells bongs". "How go
prison half year bongs?" cause was... - 'Cause famous. - 'Cause
Tommy Chong, high profile cannabis groups
distributing it, vocal. ones raided DEA
early days, not ones kind keeping themselves, keeping quiet, just
thing. always potential selective enforcement. like
initiative Oregon, state level legalization psilocybin therapy,
really interesting, part plan two years, figure integrate
federal level. don't know going go, unless rewrite
Controlled Substances Act, seems like best going get tolerance
federal government, very, hey, change administrations- -
psilocybin prescription medical doctor, talking
therapists master's degrees, PhDs, self-appointed coaches,
something like administering psilocybin, without oversight? -
getting figured Oregon case. again, two year period like,
basically, going figure out, so- - Oregon? - [laughs]
ahead lot of... know, euthanasia. - love state Oregon. - Yeah. -


interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

interesting pockets. Oregon Vermont seems one.
know, got kind pockets people experimental plant
compounds. seem green, woodsy areas, least mind. sort
culture - Yeah. - around plants use plants therapeutics. - combine
West, just geographically, anti-federalism, mean,
Oregon ranchers several years ago held whatever, wildlife place,
big showdown feds, just kind West kind known
issues. combine two, hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe
kind anti- - Although, argue becoming less hippy-dippy than... Although,
was. always tradition, not just culture around drugs, certainly,
academia, tech, et cetera, West place people
tried throw off traditionalism, kind lineage like parents are,
school went to, past determinant next exciting
future. are, East Coast institution guy West Coast institution guy.
think idea kind innovation future versus stay grounded
history tradition? - Right. - And, course, great institutions sides.
interesting, Hopkins, Johns Hopkins Medical School, think real
like East Coast academic institution. East Coast.
pioneering, important, exploratory studies a, certainly not hippy-
dippy environment. - Right. Oh, yeah, conservative [interposing voices] psychiatry
department, - Yeah. - even amongst psychiatry departments. - Right. -
psychologist psychiatry department, psychiatry certainly conservative
psychology, even within academics. even amongst psychiatry departments,
conservative department. - got law federal level, got law
state local level, got question whether not going
physicians, MDs, people PhDs masters degrees, whether not will
kind free - Right. - consumption- - life coaches. - life coaches,
general public. - Right. - mean, cannabis- - Yeah. - not pot smoker. never
appealed me. just pharmacology. can buy cannabis
places US without ton risk, seems, right? - Right. - going see
time can essentially go shop Abbot Kinney Boulevard Venice,
California? right now, can go buy marijuana marijuana card.
understanding. see lot people going stores. police,
certainly, no problem it. going come time people can just


go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going

Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,

go psilocybin? think- - Like Amsterdam, long time- -
think time coming? - think so, certain point, don't know
long. hard imagine current level drug criminalization holding for...
thinking like large spans time. Like, really, 100 years, going
500 years? that... not going sustainable. - five years,
instance? - don't think United States. think eventually going
see something like that, cause going no way, think going to,
hope going eventually come strongly, going move
model criminalizing drugs. really going focus regulating drugs
right level drug. like word regulation better legalization. mean,
imagine one day regulation, smart regulation, might mean psychedelics.
Maybe mean will be, whether not diagnosis
problem, may even personal exploration, can legally,
first maybe take court, get drive. been, not first say
this, get equivalent driver's license. go get sort training.
Maybe first number experiences need trained guides can facilitate
it. public health information anyone using this, risk
use is. use going risks. risk use is. less risky use.
factors. think, eventually, going be... say
thing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine. drugs, hard
imagine current approach just feeding black market, really exasperating
lot harms drugs happens current model, hard imagine
maintaining. isn't say, think 7-Elevens sold kids.
extreme- - hope not. - think probably not going soon
United States. want make major point, even psychedelics
never made illegal, think exact, trajectory medical research right
now still need happen. effective antidepressant, need be...
evidence suggesting, whatever disorder talking about,
efficacy going increased, risks going mitigated drastically
types models talking screening, preparation,
integration cognitive behavioral therapy, you, depending disorder,
treating, integration afterwards professionals.
anyway. not like versus that. don't see race
decriminalization legalization compounds versus medical development.


people psychedelic fans get bunch medical
development. say, guys want like, want keep medical
research ivory tower, want control academics. take
is, didn't make illegal anyone. moving needle one direction.
again, even already illegal... done plenty survey research people
reporting took mushrooms fun, personal exploration, said,
god, smoking, quit smoking 20 years it, helped
depression, helped overcoming alcoholism, [mumbles].
Sometimes happens blue people use psychedelics. None less,
obviously, efficacy rates going higher bring medical
models, going safer. - Sure. - need pushing that. best
guess, MDMA going approved within next three years- -
prescription physician? - Yes. not just take two call morning, -
Right. - clinics, way PTSD trials run. MDMA
approved PTSD, every disorder needs looked separately,
going approved things. Now, going be- - Right, 'cause
approved, legalized, regulated, now, getting nuance. think
people hear going approved two years, think able buy,
sell, use MDMA without legal consequences, not think going
situation. - Right, not going case. - not way is. will
say, think the, quote/unquote, "psychedelic community", mean,
want to, will carry want anyway, right? not
like legal status - [Dr. Matthew] Yeah. - prevented
doing. fact, unlike Leary, Timothy Leary, Huxley, others
vocal lost jobs, 'em even went jail, et cetera. mean,
got lot public figures now, like McKenna others, just basically
talking psychedelics. Michael Pollan, writer, foodie guide
gone psychedelic dabbler writer guy. know kind polymath. know, legal
status didn't seem hinder their, least, online careers. don't know. haven't looked
bank accounts. imagining just fine, right? - Right. -
fact work happening inside big institutions, think important
point out, just trying underscore, no way antagonistic
people doing. support different sort mission, explore
validity different contexts really controlled way,



02:18:35 Psychedelics Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury

really, think really important mission. want make sure ask
really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,
neurologic injury head injury. realize, early days this, think lot
concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,
god. - jack hammer- - mean, not just like- - Yeah.
colleague works bioengineering. look the... know,
always think sports, many people make living way is,
time, detrimental brain, don't option just not
professional athlete, something sort. - not construction,
someone else needs it- - Someone else it, right. reason,
I, too, didn't occur heard it, like people construction.
then, course, bike accidents, falls, things like well. So- - Military. -
Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - think potential compounds,
particular psilocybin, compounds well, treatment possible even
reversal neurological injuries, sorts things excited
realm? - Yeah, definitely exploratory end. based upon...
know, sort beyond improvement psychiatric disorders, like
depression, depression anxiety associated terminal illness, substance use
disorder, addiction. sort psychiatric disorders. is...
anecdotes people saying, psychedelics helped heal brain.
one situations, like sports, sport repetitive head
impact, claiming using psychedelics actually improved
cognitive function, example, improve memory, including improve mood.
kind cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, caveat is,
successfully improved someone's depression, can get cognitive
improvement too, - Sure. - weaker, indirect effect.


take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread
light, really appreciate doing. great, great medium
going on. thank it.

really important mission involved respect
psychedelics, not depression, per se, neurological,

concussion there, sadly. lot TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just
sports. think people sometimes forget not, major source traumatic
head injury not football. not hockey. not boxing. not stuff.
construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - it's- - Yeah. - mean, ever seen
helmets construction workers wear. mean, that- - jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh,

mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle
dark time, now, light. - Thank you. Well, thanks helping spread

take anecdotes, combine way across orders analysis rodent
research several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, folks shown
different forms neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort post-acutely. after,
days following administration psychedelic compounds, variety psychedelic
compounds, even non-psychedelic structural analogs, see
different forms neural plasticity. growth dendrites, new connections
formed different neurons. effects may play, prove,
psychiatric treatments dealing with, don't know that. seems like
decent guess, going figuring whether case. another
potential sets up, maybe that's, going claims
improvements neurological issues, actually repair brain
injuries underlying things that... Situations repetitive head impact, perhaps
potential helping folks recover stroke, disorders like that.
wide variety disorders. Now, bit magic, bit like, something
enthusiasts kind can hand waving, claim already known.
exploratory. hoping work retired athletes
exposed. nature sport, example, MMA athletes UFC
exposed repetitive head impacts, like lot sports expose people to,
retired sport, suffering from, say, depression, can,
impart, result types of, history head impact. See can fix
depression, also cherry top, exploratory aim, see can
evidence improvement cognitive function, associate like using MRI see
affects gray matter time, types things, see actually
evidence improved, like direct repair brain. again,
sort like, got rodent data. got human anecdotes. - will
acknowledge early days, look forward seeing data. appreciate
cautious are, attentive are. not drawing conclusions. think
purely logical somewhat mechanistic perspective, mean, assume lack
ability focus, degradation mood reflection neurons brain, think
can agree that, dialogue neurons brain,
needs changed nature dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. know
reordering neural circuitry require, adult, requires things, like intense
focus, followed rest, et cetera. basis that, like beneath, focuses
mechanism, mechanism, rather, beneath bin call deep rest


mechanism, mechanisms neuromodulator driven. So, me, you're...
not reviewing grant. rational perspective, seems drugs
increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin dopamine, controlled way,
coupling learning sort, sensory input sort, makes sense
lead to, could, say, lead reordering circuitry allow
better thinking, better mood, many things observed clinical
trials depression. rationale really strong. think exciting area.
get asked time TBI, traumatic brain injury, right now, kind of,
isn't whole lot people can do, people dabbling space
hyperbaric chambers, people will sauna breath work, people kind
clipping margins really problem resides deep skull.
think, just want applaud exploration. think great, provided exploration
done controlled way. sounds like UFC? -
Yeah, that's- - great- - really gracious,
colleagues headquarters Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? -
process. - Yeah. - know, dialogue going there. hopeful
going work them. process now, terms exploring it.
real interest, just really impressed organization
commitment - Yeah. - athlete health, see. - too. Yeah, too.
colleague there. little bit work them. Dunkin French,
serious academic right. think people hear UFC, just
think octagon, fighting, Pay-per-view fights, things. talking
them, sure discussions well, much
interested health longevity fighters. also interested
health longevity fighters template treat traumatic brain
injury, improve human performance sports, general public.
think not image UFC commonly comes mind, 'cause haven't
particularly verbal press. think great bringing
academics. mean, geeks like us going UFC Performance center. mean,
MMA, basically just geek walking place. fact
interested talking scientists really,

02:27:45 Shifting Trends Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture



biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind
intersection anthropology psychoactive plant compounds. Heffter
Research Institute, Dennis founding active member of, board member,
funded lot early work. also organization called Beckley
Institute based England, lady, Amanda Feilding, head of,
has... provided first funding psilocybin smoking cessation research,
Heffter came provided subsequent funding. groups.
Council Spiritual Practices. great guy named Bob Jesse funded
original work Hopkins, looking nature mystical experience outside treating
disease states disorders. just [Huberman speaks indistinctly] understanding
these... Like people take compounds, astonishingly, frequently, will say,
important thing ever experienced. like, hell that?
know? - someone mention recently, think might surprise people
little bit. certainly surprised me. friend adores children. got three
children. adores children. Happy marriage great father. great
parents. told me, part clinical trial, DMT experience
claims, said, "I'd love tell birth children profound,
profound experience birth children, one
combined". like, "Wow!" Now, never done DMT, like,
"Wow, pretty strong statement". Now, context one
clinical explorations assume part legal clinical trial. mean, saying
something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,
Heffter group, Beckley group, mean, wonderful. mean,
people holding flame alive darkest hours. thing


MAPS organization MDMA side, like holding candle
darkest years. know, we've... Smaller organizations connected smaller,
growing time, pockets wealth. basically limped along wing
prayer recently, got $17 million gift, create nominal
center. know, basically, university, means get certain
number dollars, lot them, can call center. capital
investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, always huge thing
us. $17 million gift, split Cohen foundation, Steven
Alexandra Cohen, covered half it, half, Tim Ferriss
collaborative. Basically, Tim friends ponied up, divided rest that, half
$17 million gift, came together just... mean, completely transformed our,
work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...

Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even

Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,

something. - Yeah. - saying something. mean, rational, grounded
guy, otherwise. philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - in- - recently,
sorry, just can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause can't skip it. center level funding - Oh,
yeah, can't skip- - came year half, - see. - like, we... mean,

work done, ability fully delve area, not worry that,
like, oh, focus this, rather putting another three NIDA grants
topic may may not get funded, focus much psychedelics,
putting career jeopardy? Like so- - now not tenured professor,
also full endowed- - Right. came- - way, say somebody
fully endowed professor, [Dr. Matthew laughs] - want clear
means. means funding- - Well, might mean above, no,
joking [laughs]. - no knowledge particular situation, probably
do. - Just kidding. - sure. essentially saying, funding,
not change somebody's salary level... just want clear, 'cause think general
public isn't... no reason understand nuts bolts
works. - Academia weird. - Yeah. Academia weird, not talking
increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote
time energy exploratory realms, like psychedelic research,
case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way
gone this, level rigor. mean, ask question
serotonin, people will just kind kick back me, well, yeah, got receptors,
got ligand, mean, clear care details,
care future area, also really care patients
individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years
ago, actually took job NIH review officer. remember telling
me... actually left multiple RO1s. like- - RO1s kind
bread butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - every card carrying...
mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman
laughs] lot doesn't disseminate, - [Dr. Huberman] Right. -
various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
Stanford, now labs starting explore psychedelics,
mechanistic level, animal models. excellent labs. also, can imagine,
pioneering work done Hopkins,

02:44:23 Participating Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork

it'll start become common. certain people going questions
get contact learn more. people trauma, PTSD,
depression, likely going start seeking ways can potentially
participate clinical trials. active Twitter. Active, say. got
obligations, active social media, active Twitter.
@drug_researcher, correct? - Right, right. Right. - Okay. get- - drug_researcher,
find me. - great account, way. Matthew recently got
dialogue deeper effects psychedelics literature versus
discussed general public. follow account, really
wonderful account whether not science background not. people
are... going try persuade active Instagram, don't
know succeed that. [Dr. Matthew laughs] - try get Instagram game going
on. - busy guy, get it. running lab too. get it. busy.
Drug_researcher well. - handle, huh? - handle. lab
Hopkins pretty straightforward find Google Search name, Matthew


Johnson, Johns Hopkins University. portals people explore clinical trials,
participation clinical trials various kinds? - Yeah, group, go
Hopkinspsychedelic.org. website. can't remember that, just Johns
Hopkins psychedelic. - will provide link. Yeah, will provide link. - Yeah,
going find us. It'll first thing pops up. have... Trust me,
study something, going website. - means- [interposing
voices] polite, will little bit aggressive, say, don't
email directly. won't see email. Wait posting study,
sign correct portal. - Right. try get back emails,
frankly, 'cause lucky area taken off much, many days
simply get many - Well, do- - requests can't get
day. - research. - Yeah, answer the... yeah, trust me.
something lot folks don't get, academia like are, easy
forget people don't, understandably, don't realize this. experimental
research. FDA-approved experiment, working towards formal FDA
approval straight clinical use. right now, someone can't bring case
idiosyncratic thing, say, suffering complex constellation, like
depression- - not clinician. - Yeah, not... even was, wouldn't
able treat psilocybin, send anywhere legal take it.
going treating you, be, anyone else United States,
countries matter, going guise
specific protocol. number milligrams treat PTSD, treat major depressive
disorder, treat, treatment resistant tobacco use disorder, nicotine addiction.
specific studies. not one-off treatment. folks say, like, oh, can pay go
Baltimore. Well, son complex. tragic cases, you...
interested study, go website. not website, don't
study it. going forthcoming studies. going starting studies
opioid addiction PTSD, LSD study chronic pain. day
open recruitment, going website. - Great. -
look see everything. fact, just recently, couple days ago, put
couple surveys studies, also post link survey study.
psychedelics, taken therapeutic intent PTSD,
depression, anxiety, can find link. also, done breath work
reasons, link study type now, holotropic-style,


psychedelic-type - Interesting. - breathing technique can lead
similar experiences. there. broadly, outside group, 'cause
growing number groups US this, Europe
research, can go Clinicaltrials.gov, look main search term
psilocybin, MDMA, psychedelic, plug terms, can get list
growing number. mean, think 40, maybe. awhile. might
50 now. don't know. studies just psilocybin going right now
Clinicaltrials.gov. check Clinicaltrials.gov see going on. going
be... going anything legal, going context specific
study. not going one-off treatment. - Right, say, - Yeah. - not
just legal, also supported right framework described,
team, et cetera. Obviously, people will will do. [interposing voices] - if-
- Oh, yeah, go ahead. - will say, people... never encourage people take drugs
any... don't encourage caffeine use. Every drug risk, know? - encourage
caffeine use, nobody else's. - Yeah. drinking right now. great. -
Yeah, strong maté. drinking. not lead alteration,
perception, self extent talked earlier. However,
conversation, good example can enter perceptual bubble. learned
much psychedelics, future sake mental health,
aspects health. Matt, thank much - Thank you, Andrew. - time,
knowledge. think put best earlier, holding candle

biased here, point favor. Along lines groups individuals
impacted space working pioneering psychedelic
space, years ago, think, someone submitted grant saying, want study
psilocybin impacts human depression, guessing, worked panels
before, response might've closer to, well, need lot studies
rodents, lot studies primates, maybe, just maybe, explore
drugs, National Institutes Health actually whole institute
devoted addiction, right? - Mm-hmm. - exploring compounds terms
negative effects, right? - Yeah. - very- - NIDA, gotten
NIH funding career. - interesting, right? - Yeah, uh-huh. -
super important institute. want clear, amazing people there.
philanthropy foundations important supporting pioneering
research, maybe just talk little bit that? lab receives funding
taxpayer dollars National Institutes Health? mainly
funding comes from? - group gotten funding like, say,
National Institute Drug Abuse, NIDA. some, small subset psychedelic
work, work geared towards understanding things drugs
abuse. - Right. - course, study, though, [interposing voices] - Explore
bad. - Right. - Right, right. that, can explore like
good stuff too. large majority work, interesting work,
funded philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, still grant
support NIDA outside psychedelics. - Right. - shifting
time towards focusing psychedelics. fact, us getting center-level
funding really big picture philanthropists helped start make
transition. groups like Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna,
one founding members, brother Terence McKenna, is, way,
ethnobotanist. PhD in. - mean, ethnobtanist? -
Studying, essentially, anthropology psychoactive plant use. So, know- - Wow!
can get degree that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. know, hanging cultures,
studying use compounds traditional ways. - Wow! Hopkins?
degree exists Johns Hopkins? - don't think degree exists Hopkins, - Oh,
okay. - mean, kind most... know academia, not... know,
sometimes folks... not sure many people's PhD actually ethnobotany,
actually - Yeah, never heard of- - something else. real focus is...


degree general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids just decided
going major ethnobotany, but, know- - mean, one pioneers
psychedelic area, Leary, before, actually, late, even
human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, Abram Hoffer, Sidney Cohen
earlier. even folks, Richard Schultes Harvard, mentioned
earlier conversation, discovered now. various tribes using
ayahuasca yagé, different name thing, throughout South America,
DMT containing snuffs, this. ethnobotany, kind

increasing. not talking endowment philanthropy went
increase Matt's salary. something set university level. always
said, is, least, still true now, nobody goes science
money, least not academic level, not academia. allows people devote

case lab, work David Spiegel's lab, respiration
breath work hypnosis modulating brain states. not typically areas
National Institutes Health major organizations have, institutions set
support. Now, exciting initiative, NCCIH, Complimentary
Health. - Right. Used NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, changed name. -
NIH. - Yeah. - now, not just throwing acronyms just bat back forth


acronyms. think looking, seeing now movement toward
science, scientists, clinicians, general public, philanthropy
engaged dialogue, says, okay, problems world, depression,
head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. problems clearly exist.
solutions going involve behaviors going involve nutrition,
supplementation, social connection. However, drugs, compounds
can change brain, allow brain change circuitry experience,
psychedelics one several others, one powerful leavers, sounds
like. just want say, think reason reached you,
excited sit chat is, see people inside halls
academia thrown arms around issue psychedelics way,
gone trouble trying find funding get done, gone
trouble trying set clinical trials. know involved this.
complicated. time-consuming painstaking. made real progress.
mean, guys publishing papers. new dialogue emerging isn't just
books bookshelves psychedelic, psychonaut gurus internet, also play
important role. really moving field forward. know others
well. colleagues England others well. acknowledge them.
just want say personally, inspired impressed way

individuals. know speaking behalf ton people now,
future, don't even know going receive consequence this.
just want voice real sincere thank effort. like lab work
matters, really special unique thing. - appreciate that. fact,
good colleague, fact, shared grants support multi-PI system years

mark respect community one several these, yeah. - Yeah,
yeah. like eat kill academia. gets talking
later, like don't make money pulling grants, able pay


salary that... university doesn't pay salary. goes them. -
Right. just able work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - able to...
don't pull grants cover salary, job can come end. Even
tenured place like Hopkins, can tricks, like slowly lower salary over- -
Well, just let- [interposing voices] just take away space. - Yeah,
put closet, give no support trainees, basically make life hell
you. can drive - happens. - cab Baltimore, call full professor
Hopkins, truthfully, may not no ability get anything done. - sure
there. - yeah, remember one things colleague said,
successful, left top said, "I really don't know making difference
world?" great memory research connected drugs, also
connected aging. said, "I don't feel impact real
world". Unfortunately, there, lot academia, do, stays ivory tower.
world a... - Not anymore. - beautiful, messed place, [Dr. Huberman

various structures, way world set up. thankfully, this... mean,
work group, well others around world, last 20 years,
like emerging psychedelic startup industry now billions dollars
investment. yeah, going turn good bad. know,
upping ante. going lot good bad comes that, - Sure. -
new technology going result that. got psilocybin designated
two separate entities breakthrough therapy FDA, people may not realize,
MDMA designated breakthrough therapy PTSD. really big
deal. high... mean, pharma companies pay millions dollars get
new drug designation like that. means, early research showing,
saying shows high potential treating disorders don't good
treatments. probably, again, years away MDMA, probably
year two, psilocybin, treated PTSD depression
respectively. know, wait Phase 3 studies, results hold
up... Even effect size halved seeing now, still going lot
larger seeing traditional medications. going
approved, data hold up, probably will judgment. feel like
actually positive impact world way that... feel lucky
got interested area happens plug place world


opportunity, great colleagues friends focused areas
wish opportunity work disseminated. mean,
lucky interviewed "60 Minutes" work. like, oh,
god, know many... bit imposter syndrome, like, oh, god, know
many scientists deserve, me, be, level exposure.
happen place where, got best make work, take
advantage luck, intersection world, push it. lucky,
also take bit leap faith early on. advisors told me,
like, got really promising pedigree early on, like, sure want focus
much time psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, embraced risk. mean, think that...
mean, world's changed since, 2020, certainly, channels like social media,
podcasts, things sort, exposure people interested
topics, people, like myself, interested talking you. mean
