pleased announce Huberman Lab Podcast now partnered
Momentous supplements. partnered Momentous several important reasons.
First all, ship internationally, know many located
outside United States, valuable. Second all, perhaps important,
quality supplements second none, terms purity precision
amounts ingredients. Third, really emphasized supplements
single ingredient supplements supplied dosages allow build


supplementation protocol optimized cost, optimized effectiveness,
can add things remove things protocol way really
systematic scientific. really hard taking blends different
supplements dosages can't titrate, adjust

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ

recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated

deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say

several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture

like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly

fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric

much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones

continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal

supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian

trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic

also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
powerful tool, again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool tap
endogenous, meaning within exists within physiology order increase
acetylcholine

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated
states. don't tend use white noise pink noise work, know
number people do. know people also use called brown noise.
folks know engineering computer science side get really details
white noise, pink noise, brown noise. can find white noise, pink noise brown

bumper behind forehead, directly related ability direct
focus remain focused certain things. option either using
binaural beats before, not work, 40 HZ binaural beats, 40 HZ
binaural beats throughout attempt focus. also option not using
binaural beats, using white noise, pink noise brown noise. Again, lot
zero cost apps, can find also white noise, pink noise brown noise YouTube.
Again, tools really shown humans

00:22:55 Warm-Up Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity

allow people focus depth decrease transition time focus.
really key point. lot people challenged getting mode
focus. None us, however, expected just sit drop directly

instance, wouldn't expect go track go run not
warm up. might jog minutes even walk jog
jog run, right, hope that.
resistance training, doubt go load bar machine
maximum amount weight can move just drop right that,
always warmup. think important understand mental work, focus
concentration requiring warmup. warmup? Well, know
warmup is. warmup ramping increase epinephrine,

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian
cycles. probably heard circadian cycles circadian biology, circa, day,
circadian, 24 hour cycle. Well, brain body operate within day
within every day say 90 minute ultradian cycles.
suggestion anytime going sit try focus going
try focused physical exercise skill learning musical learning,
maybe even just conversation, maybe therapist
attending therapy class, long be? ideal duration 90


minutes, not exactly 90 minutes, can reliably say 90 minutes less, okay,
doesn't full 90 minutes. trying push able drop
two hours focus three hours focus, possible not really line
know underlying biology. Everything sleep states different
stages sleep waking states divided 90 minute cycles so-called
ultradian cycles. like set timer 90 minutes. acknowledge
accept fact conditions unless really pressed deadline
optimally caffeinated, et cetera, first five 10 minutes 90 minutes
transition time, like warm focus, include 90 minutes.
really try drop focused mental work learning sort, again,
physical well, motor skill learning anything, running lifting
weights, et cetera, really try drop across full 90 minutes,
accepting fact, okay not just idea, fact occasionally focus will
flicker, will jump focus, big part able focus go back
focusing. way like conceptualize perhaps arrowhead suddenly
getting very, broad, focusing many things arrow shifts
different location room. key able shift back narrow

might feel rather tired even exhausted. important
focus take least 10 minutes ideally long 30 minutes go
call deliberate defocus. really want focus somewhat menial tasks
things really don't require ton concentration. starting become
little bit movement kind pop psychology optimization world,
idea not looking phone walk hall bathroom,
certainly not looking phone bathroom. mention, way,
particular annoyance mine, noticed wait times restrooms
public places increased substantially last 10 years? reason not

everybody else favor staying off phone restroom, staying


off phone walking hall. Try give time

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled
things can't perform much intense work. intensity work scales directly
long need rest work. stage life pretty good
dropping maintaining focused bouts concentration provided landscape
life right, know, don't burning stressful thing essential
emergency tending put phone away turn off, can three
90 minute focus bouts per day, it. focus
bouts, things require less focus. may able
perform four. highly recommend try least one, one 90
minute less focused concentrated work per day, yes, means
weekends too. weekends, like read book phone nowhere
sight, not device, listen audiobook sometimes
taking walk, really concentrating trying learn, hearing
seeing. again, daily 90 minute one start say
four weeks that, able stay concentrated work
agitation, consider increasing number focus bouts. Again, not
say go teacher PhD advisor parent
friends say, "Listen, can't really concentrate think anything
90 minutes per day." not saying. deep focus bouts.
bouts work, say mental work physical work really forcing
focus refocus, sharpen head arrowhead, redirect
trying concentrate on, indeed hard work.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision

illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater

concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage

concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back

network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling

restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive

allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay

cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-

modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated

00:09:37 “Arrow Model” Focus: Epinephrine, Acetylcholine & Dopamine

Again, eightsleep.com/huberman save $250 off Eight Sleep cover now
September 11th. Okay, talk focus concentration
can improve focus concentration using science based protocols. Now
today's episode mainly focused tools not much underlying mechanisms,
mainly going focus it. just want
take three minutes briefly describe model, visual image
can put mind, will help incorporate tools provide
generally will help understand mechanistic level focus concentration
work. want imagine arrow. arrow course,
arrowhead shaft arrow. context neuroscience
focus concentration, neurochemical system really represents shaft
arrow, right, straight line epinephrine, also called adrenaline. today,
refer adrenaline epinephrine interchangeably. Turns
epinephrine/adrenaline released within brain little location, little cluster
neurons called locus coeruleus, not need remember name,
body adrenal glands. release epinephrine two
locations overall increases energy, increases alertness. not alone increase
focus, okay? reason assigned epinephrine, adrenaline shaft
arrow focus arrow, no focus without epinephrine. things,
whether not behavioral psychological supplements drugs increase
epinephrine allow focus occur, necessary focus, not sufficient
focus, required not enough create focus.
going need epinephrine equation. Without epinephrine, no focus
concentration. Now arrowhead metaphorical arrowhead represents focus
concentration going represented related mechanisms
acetylcholine, different neurochemical also exists brain body. fact,
body, responsible contraction movement muscles. today,
talking acetylcholine not context, rather context
release within brain. Acetylcholine released couple different locations
brain best way think like spotlight. highlights specific


neurons, nerve cells active, active say,
neurons environment. reason assigned arrowhead acetylcholine
acetylcholine arrowhead arrow big
arrowhead really broad, really broad, imagine mile wide arrowhead, not
focused one location, not really pointing one location, it?
narrow, really tightly focused arrowhead, well, focused one location.

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
powerful tool, again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool tap
endogenous, meaning within exists within physiology order increase
acetylcholine

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated
states. don't tend use white noise pink noise work, know
number people do. know people also use called brown noise.
folks know engineering computer science side get really details
white noise, pink noise, brown noise. can find white noise, pink noise brown
noise listen headphones room. indeed data
support fact white noise, extent, pink noise brown noise can


support release particular neurochemicals, data showing can
amplify activity neurons so-called prefrontal cortex, front area, sort
bumper behind forehead, directly related ability direct
focus remain focused certain things. option either using
binaural beats before, not work, 40 HZ binaural beats, 40 HZ
binaural beats throughout attempt focus. also option not using
binaural beats, using white noise, pink noise brown noise. Again, lot
zero cost apps, can find also white noise, pink noise brown noise YouTube.
Again, tools really shown humans

00:22:55 Warm-Up Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity

allow people focus depth decrease transition time focus.
really key point. lot people challenged getting mode
focus. None us, however, expected just sit drop directly
state focus. think completely unfair request ourselves. mean,
instance, wouldn't expect go track go run not
warm up. might jog minutes even walk jog
jog run, right, hope that.
resistance training, doubt go load bar machine
maximum amount weight can move just drop right that,
always warmup. think important understand mental work, focus
concentration requiring warmup. warmup? Well, know
warmup is. warmup ramping increase epinephrine,
adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine. Right, way neurochemicals work
don't just get flip switches brain decide to, fantasy.
sort "Limitless" movie movies ideas suddenly going flip
switch arm sudden going laser focus, just not
way nervous system works. gradual dropping state,
whether not state sleep, right, go shallow sleep deep sleep
eventually. Focus too, go shallow focus increasingly deep focus.
is, metaphor arrow, broad, pointed lot things.
time drop focus, arrow narrowing narrowing narrowing.
fact, probably better think narrowing sometimes oscillating


getting wider again. might hear something hallway typically

not like go unfocused focused drop maximal focus.
understanding dynamic, understanding going continually
going progressively varying levels focus, will greatly release
pressure feel focused time want be. key.
People good focusing understand understand can't
expect just immediately focus snap focus. Okay
patient also understand focus ability, can improve
ability focus engaging neural circuits responsible focus repeatedly
time so-called neuroplasticity, ability nervous system change
response experience. couple different components, put
simply, repeat gets etched nervous system becomes easier
time. emotionally important vital something feels us, likely
trigger neuroplasticity. going talk little bit increase
neural circuits focus later, right now, hand key importance

based tools improving focus, 40 HZ binaural beats used
bouts focus concentration. don't like those, even do,

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian
cycles. probably heard circadian cycles circadian biology, circa, day,
circadian, 24 hour cycle. Well, brain body operate within day
within every day say 90 minute ultradian cycles.
suggestion anytime going sit try focus going
try focused physical exercise skill learning musical learning,
maybe even just conversation, maybe therapist
attending therapy class, long be? ideal duration 90


minutes, not exactly 90 minutes, can reliably say 90 minutes less, okay,
doesn't full 90 minutes. trying push able drop
two hours focus three hours focus, possible not really line
know underlying biology. Everything sleep states different
stages sleep waking states divided 90 minute cycles so-called
ultradian cycles. like set timer 90 minutes. acknowledge
accept fact conditions unless really pressed deadline
optimally caffeinated, et cetera, first five 10 minutes 90 minutes
transition time, like warm focus, include 90 minutes.
really try drop focused mental work learning sort, again,
physical well, motor skill learning anything, running lifting
weights, et cetera, really try drop across full 90 minutes,
accepting fact, okay not just idea, fact occasionally focus will
flicker, will jump focus, big part able focus go back
focusing. way like conceptualize perhaps arrowhead suddenly
getting very, broad, focusing many things arrow shifts
different location room. key able shift back narrow
active process, much requires lot metabolic energy,
brain chief consumer metabolic energy. calories consume,
so-called basal metabolic rate, isn't related movement heartbeat
breathing, related brain function. brain glutton respect caloric
need. understand end 90 minutes maybe even 45 minutes,
might feel rather tired even exhausted. important
focus take least 10 minutes ideally long 30 minutes go
call deliberate defocus. really want focus somewhat menial tasks
things really don't require ton concentration. starting become
little bit movement kind pop psychology optimization world,
idea not looking phone walk hall bathroom,
certainly not looking phone bathroom. mention, way,
particular annoyance mine, noticed wait times restrooms
public places increased substantially last 10 years? reason not
digestive, okay, not gut microbiome, mean might gut microbiome,
chances people phones bathroom.
everybody else favor staying off phone restroom, staying


off phone walking hall. Try give time
deliberately decompress, let mental states idle, not focused one
thing. period idling essential ability focus, much way

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled
things can't perform much intense work. intensity work scales directly
long need rest work. stage life pretty good
dropping maintaining focused bouts concentration provided landscape
life right, know, don't burning stressful thing essential
emergency tending put phone away turn off, can three
90 minute focus bouts per day, it. focus
bouts, things require less focus. may able
perform four. highly recommend try least one, one 90
minute less focused concentrated work per day, yes, means
weekends too. weekends, like read book phone nowhere
sight, not device, listen audiobook sometimes
taking walk, really concentrating trying learn, hearing
seeing. again, daily 90 minute one start say
four weeks that, able stay concentrated work
agitation, consider increasing number focus bouts. Again, not
say go teacher PhD advisor parent
friends say, "Listen, can't really concentrate think anything
90 minutes per day." not saying. deep focus bouts.
bouts work, say mental work physical work really forcing
focus refocus, sharpen head arrowhead, redirect
trying concentrate on, indeed hard work.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress

stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive

circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning

01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back

caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also

people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
powerful tool, again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool tap
endogenous, meaning within exists within physiology order increase
acetylcholine

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated
states. don't tend use white noise pink noise work, know
number people do. know people also use called brown noise.
folks know engineering computer science side get really details
white noise, pink noise, brown noise. can find white noise, pink noise brown
noise listen headphones room. indeed data
support fact white noise, extent, pink noise brown noise can


support release particular neurochemicals, data showing can
amplify activity neurons so-called prefrontal cortex, front area, sort
bumper behind forehead, directly related ability direct
focus remain focused certain things. option either using
binaural beats before, not work, 40 HZ binaural beats, 40 HZ
binaural beats throughout attempt focus. also option not using
binaural beats, using white noise, pink noise brown noise. Again, lot
zero cost apps, can find also white noise, pink noise brown noise YouTube.
Again, tools really shown humans

00:22:55 Warm-Up Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity

allow people focus depth decrease transition time focus.
really key point. lot people challenged getting mode
focus. None us, however, expected just sit drop directly
state focus. think completely unfair request ourselves. mean,
instance, wouldn't expect go track go run not
warm up. might jog minutes even walk jog
jog run, right, hope that.
resistance training, doubt go load bar machine
maximum amount weight can move just drop right that,
always warmup. think important understand mental work, focus
concentration requiring warmup. warmup? Well, know
warmup is. warmup ramping increase epinephrine,
adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine. Right, way neurochemicals work
don't just get flip switches brain decide to, fantasy.
sort "Limitless" movie movies ideas suddenly going flip
switch arm sudden going laser focus, just not
way nervous system works. gradual dropping state,
whether not state sleep, right, go shallow sleep deep sleep
eventually. Focus too, go shallow focus increasingly deep focus.

bouts focus concentration. don't like those, even do,

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian
cycles. probably heard circadian cycles circadian biology, circa, day,
circadian, 24 hour cycle. Well, brain body operate within day
within every day say 90 minute ultradian cycles.
suggestion anytime going sit try focus going
try focused physical exercise skill learning musical learning,
maybe even just conversation, maybe therapist
attending therapy class, long be? ideal duration 90


minutes, not exactly 90 minutes, can reliably say 90 minutes less, okay,
doesn't full 90 minutes. trying push able drop
two hours focus three hours focus, possible not really line
know underlying biology. Everything sleep states different
stages sleep waking states divided 90 minute cycles so-called
ultradian cycles. like set timer 90 minutes. acknowledge
accept fact conditions unless really pressed deadline
optimally caffeinated, et cetera, first five 10 minutes 90 minutes
transition time, like warm focus, include 90 minutes.
really try drop focused mental work learning sort, again,
physical well, motor skill learning anything, running lifting
weights, et cetera, really try drop across full 90 minutes,
accepting fact, okay not just idea, fact occasionally focus will
flicker, will jump focus, big part able focus go back
focusing. way like conceptualize perhaps arrowhead suddenly
getting very, broad, focusing many things arrow shifts
different location room. key able shift back narrow
active process, much requires lot metabolic energy,
brain chief consumer metabolic energy. calories consume,
so-called basal metabolic rate, isn't related movement heartbeat
breathing, related brain function. brain glutton respect caloric
need. understand end 90 minutes maybe even 45 minutes,
might feel rather tired even exhausted. important
focus take least 10 minutes ideally long 30 minutes go
call deliberate defocus. really want focus somewhat menial tasks
things really don't require ton concentration. starting become
little bit movement kind pop psychology optimization world,
idea not looking phone walk hall bathroom,
certainly not looking phone bathroom. mention, way,
particular annoyance mine, noticed wait times restrooms
public places increased substantially last 10 years? reason not

everybody else favor staying off phone restroom, staying


off phone walking hall. Try give time
deliberately decompress, let mental states idle, not focused one

will allow

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled
things can't perform much intense work. intensity work scales directly
long need rest work. stage life pretty good
dropping maintaining focused bouts concentration provided landscape
life right, know, don't burning stressful thing essential
emergency tending put phone away turn off, can three
90 minute focus bouts per day, it. focus
bouts, things require less focus. may able
perform four. highly recommend try least one, one 90
minute less focused concentrated work per day, yes, means
weekends too. weekends, like read book phone nowhere
sight, not device, listen audiobook sometimes
taking walk, really concentrating trying learn, hearing
seeing. again, daily 90 minute one start say
four weeks that, able stay concentrated work
agitation, consider increasing number focus bouts. Again, not
say go teacher PhD advisor parent
friends say, "Listen, can't really concentrate think anything
90 minutes per day." not saying. deep focus bouts.
bouts work, say mental work physical work really forcing
focus refocus, sharpen head arrowhead, redirect
trying concentrate on, indeed hard work.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress

stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back

network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even

restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping

can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app

focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app

benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children

visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance Sleep

go hubermanlab.com ever want
mechanisms. jump tools concentration focus. want think
tools kind modify biology physiology way, whether not
cognitive function want get better exercising, want build
muscle, want improve hormones, need think understand tools
context modulation mediation. mean that? Well, quite
simple really. Mediation specific types chemicals cells circuits
organs control specific things brain body whereas modulation
ability chemicals cells circuits adjust different things change,
different things work brain body, broadly. mean
this? Let give example. instance, going tell now one
important things build maintain focus concentration optimize
sleeping behavior, get enough quality sleep say 80% nights
life. Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100% nights life, nobody,
truly nobody achieves that. However, sleep shown relate cognitive
performance, physical performance, hormone output, many things,
including immune system function. can reliably say sleep modulates just
every process brain body. get great sleep.
simply no tool going allow overcome chronic sleep deprivation allow
remain focused, no pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
tools overcome one night maybe two nights sleep deprivation talk
those, fundamental level, need things modulate
focus attention powerful ways sleep really thing. done two
episodes, one called "Master Sleep" episode "Perfect Sleep."
"Perfect Sleep" little bit like episode, focused protocols.


"Master Sleep" includes protocols mechanism. Again, can find
hubermanlab.com. also sleep toolkit, distilled list things order
optimize sleep. highly recommend download that. can go
hubermanlab.com, go Neural Network Newsletter, listed there. want
can sign newsletter, don't to, can simply download PDF
toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
powerful tool, again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool tap
endogenous, meaning within exists within physiology order increase
acetylcholine

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated
states. don't tend use white noise pink noise work, know
number people do. know people also use called brown noise.
folks know engineering computer science side get really details
white noise, pink noise, brown noise. can find white noise, pink noise brown
noise listen headphones room. indeed data
support fact white noise, extent, pink noise brown noise can


support release particular neurochemicals, data showing can
amplify activity neurons so-called prefrontal cortex, front area, sort
bumper behind forehead, directly related ability direct
focus remain focused certain things. option either using
binaural beats before, not work, 40 HZ binaural beats, 40 HZ
binaural beats throughout attempt focus. also option not using
binaural beats, using white noise, pink noise brown noise. Again, lot
zero cost apps, can find also white noise, pink noise brown noise YouTube.
Again, tools really shown humans

00:22:55 Warm-Up Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity

allow people focus depth decrease transition time focus.
really key point. lot people challenged getting mode
focus. None us, however, expected just sit drop directly
state focus. think completely unfair request ourselves. mean,
instance, wouldn't expect go track go run not
warm up. might jog minutes even walk jog
jog run, right, hope that.
resistance training, doubt go load bar machine
maximum amount weight can move just drop right that,
always warmup. think important understand mental work, focus
concentration requiring warmup. warmup? Well, know
warmup is. warmup ramping increase epinephrine,
adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine. Right, way neurochemicals work
don't just get flip switches brain decide to, fantasy.
sort "Limitless" movie movies ideas suddenly going flip
switch arm sudden going laser focus, just not
way nervous system works. gradual dropping state,
whether not state sleep, right, go shallow sleep deep sleep
eventually. Focus too, go shallow focus increasingly deep focus.
is, metaphor arrow, broad, pointed lot things.
time drop focus, arrow narrowing narrowing narrowing.
fact, probably better think narrowing sometimes oscillating


getting wider again. might hear something hallway typically

not like go unfocused focused drop maximal focus.
understanding dynamic, understanding going continually
going progressively varying levels focus, will greatly release
pressure feel focused time want be. key.
People good focusing understand understand can't
expect just immediately focus snap focus. Okay
patient also understand focus ability, can improve
ability focus engaging neural circuits responsible focus repeatedly

simply, repeat gets etched nervous system becomes easier
time. emotionally important vital something feels us, likely
trigger neuroplasticity. going talk little bit increase
neural circuits focus later, right now, hand key importance

Newsletter really work optimizing sleep. also got two auditory sound
based tools improving focus, 40 HZ binaural beats used
bouts focus concentration. don't like those, even do,

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian
cycles. probably heard circadian cycles circadian biology, circa, day,
circadian, 24 hour cycle. Well, brain body operate within day
within every day say 90 minute ultradian cycles.
suggestion anytime going sit try focus going
try focused physical exercise skill learning musical learning,
maybe even just conversation, maybe therapist
attending therapy class, long be? ideal duration 90


minutes, not exactly 90 minutes, can reliably say 90 minutes less, okay,
doesn't full 90 minutes. trying push able drop

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled
things can't perform much intense work. intensity work scales directly
long need rest work. stage life pretty good
dropping maintaining focused bouts concentration provided landscape
life right, know, don't burning stressful thing essential
emergency tending put phone away turn off, can three
90 minute focus bouts per day, it. focus
bouts, things require less focus. may able
perform four. highly recommend try least one, one 90
minute less focused concentrated work per day, yes, means
weekends too. weekends, like read book phone nowhere
sight, not device, listen audiobook sometimes
taking walk, really concentrating trying learn, hearing
seeing. again, daily 90 minute one start say
four weeks that, able stay concentrated work
agitation, consider increasing number focus bouts. Again, not
say go teacher PhD advisor parent
friends say, "Listen, can't really concentrate think anything
90 minutes per day." not saying. deep focus bouts.
bouts work, say mental work physical work really forcing
focus refocus, sharpen head arrowhead, redirect
trying concentrate on, indeed hard work.

concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,

wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate

fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling

try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive

allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay

cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior

concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus

model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

toolkit zero cost. say sleep modulates focus attention? Well,
give analogy. right now someone pulled fire alarm building
fire building, attention drift, not recording podcast,
something else. say fire alarm mediates attention?
mean fire alarms not really involved attention. No, rather modulate
attention. noise room modulates attention.

00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats Improve Concentration

quite bit different tool provide later just give little hint
now, fact, give now, 40 HZ binaural beats
shown number peer reviewed studies increase focus concentration.
like access 40 HZ binaural beats order improve focus
concentration, can that, can actually get zero cost. can go
app store, instance, Apple App Store, also available Android phone,
app called BrainWave, can go there, can dial 40 HZ it'll
play binaural beats. shown multiple quality peer reviewed studies
playing pattern sound waves one ear, do, do, do, do, do, ear,
slightly offset frequency, meaning not quite frequencies, like do,
do, do, do, combination frequencies played different ears, actually get
integrated within deep brain centers can increase focus concentration part
increasing levels neurochemical dopamine acetylcholine, talked
little bit earlier arrow model focus. provide link app,
don't relationship app mention, excellent one, one
used many years. also additional functions within app,
sleep things, 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z way reads out, 40 HZ
stimulation shown improve focus concentration.
recommendation way use it. not use 40 HZ binaural beats every
time work. tend use five minutes prior


work turn off work talk tools use
work, whether not reading math even just emailing something
require bunch focus while. However, times
area state mind feeling distractable keep 40
HZ binaural beats entire time cognitive work. also
sometimes use 40 HZ binaural beats prior workout, particular weight
workouts, really want able focus contract specific muscles.
useful tool, again, supported quality peer reviewed science, zero cost,
available not just BrainWave app multiple apps. think many
will benefit it. might not experience immediately total
dropping tunnel focus way might say sorts
neurochemicals talk later, like Alpha-GPC
things change neurochemicals directly, nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
powerful tool, again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool tap
endogenous, meaning within exists within physiology order increase
acetylcholine

00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition Focused State

neurochemicals shown work quite well. Okay
assuming sleeping well 80% nights life least working
various protocols tools sleep well sufficiently long 80% nights
life, interested additional tools sound based order
improve ability concentrate focus, quality peer reviewed studies
supporting idea white noise pink noise, believe not,
something called pink noise, specific frequencies sound
noise, well white noise pink noise shown not improve
concentration per se, improve people's ability transition concentrated
states. don't tend use white noise pink noise work, know
number people do. know people also use called brown noise.
folks know engineering computer science side get really details
white noise, pink noise, brown noise. can find white noise, pink noise brown
noise listen headphones room. indeed data
support fact white noise, extent, pink noise brown noise can


support release particular neurochemicals, data showing can
amplify activity neurons so-called prefrontal cortex, front area, sort
bumper behind forehead, directly related ability direct
focus remain focused certain things. option either using
binaural beats before, not work, 40 HZ binaural beats, 40 HZ
binaural beats throughout attempt focus. also option not using
binaural beats, using white noise, pink noise brown noise. Again, lot
zero cost apps, can find also white noise, pink noise brown noise YouTube.
Again, tools really shown humans

00:22:55 Warm-Up Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity

allow people focus depth decrease transition time focus.
really key point. lot people challenged getting mode
focus. None us, however, expected just sit drop directly

instance, wouldn't expect go track go run not
warm up. might jog minutes even walk jog
jog run, right, hope that.
resistance training, doubt go load bar machine
maximum amount weight can move just drop right that,
always warmup. think important understand mental work, focus

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown
noise, also readily available zero cost. question often get long try
focus? Well, research literature point key importance so-called ultradian
cycles. probably heard circadian cycles circadian biology, circa, day,
circadian, 24 hour cycle. Well, brain body operate within day
within every day say 90 minute ultradian cycles.
suggestion anytime going sit try focus going

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled

concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,

tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate

fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention

cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,

prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental

combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal

anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-

sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging

can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing

might alternate occasionally use white noise, pink noise brown

00:31:22 Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform?

drop intense spouts focus repeatedly repeatedly throughout day.
often asked many ultradian cycles one can perform throughout day?
depends well slept, well nourished, talk
moment, well trained focus capacity is. paradox,
trained focusing, good dropping focus, actually
going need deliberate decompression defocus recommend
two, maybe three deep work sessions per day. not one 90 minute session
expecting another one another one, another one, rather one


deep work 90 minute session, maybe another afternoon. lot people get
surprised say, "Wait, many people can afford just work three hours
day?" not saying just work three hours day. really talking hard mental
work. again, somewhat paradoxically, can concentrate,
deeply can concentrate, fewer deep work concentration bouts can actually
perform day. makes sense, however, think context say
resistance training. stronger stronger gym, endurance
athlete can run ultra-marathons, 100 miles so, essentially cutting
deeper cut recovery capacity somebody not skilled

amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus

fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams

concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,

wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate

fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus

weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not

right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision

illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects

stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering

concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state

circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one

01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic

provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea

maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-

phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't

several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study

different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere

weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't

also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one

like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three

cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging

immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back

caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows

can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory

However, food, enough it, gut full, diverts
blood gut become sleepy can't focus well. lot people
really like fasting state fasted focus concentration

physical health performance, check episode fasting
hubermanlab.com. also want touch back idea foods can increase
focus. know, episode ADHD did, touched quite bit
relates elimination diets. whole industry ton interest obvious
reasons sorts things kids adults shouldn't eat order
reduce symptoms ADHD. think sum total data point fact
reducing simple sugar intake certainly highly processed foods, ice cream, candy,
chips, et cetera, sorts things, really seem improve symptoms ADHD


children adults. move past start say, well,
foods can improve concentration focus? Well, foods instance include
lot tyrosine, precursor dopamine, now know dopamine
important context, certainly going increase concentration focus.
things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts, can look foods
contain high amounts tyrosine. also fruits vegetables include
high amounts tyrosine, quite direct, doesn't matter whether not
ingesting foods rich precursor amino acids dopamine, acetylcholine, et
cetera, consuming large amounts foods. one can look see
instance, steak includes lot precursors acetylcholine. amino
acid precursors dopamine well foods will well,
ingest say two ribeye steaks, lot meat will direct lot
blood gut will cause sleepy will create challenges
able achieve states focus concentration. simple way put
eat much eat large volume food, going diminish
focus concentration. key eat enough nourished
certain activities, mental physical need perform,

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic
compounds least aware like way tastes
provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper

not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly

fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows

talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated

period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form

uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior

like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve

supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions

foods can improve concentration focus? Well, foods instance include
lot tyrosine, precursor dopamine, now know dopamine
important context, certainly going increase concentration focus.
things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts, can look foods

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior

people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,

number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate

fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going

weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

children adults. move past start say, well,
foods can improve concentration focus? Well, foods instance include
lot tyrosine, precursor dopamine, now know dopamine
important context, certainly going increase concentration focus.
things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts, can look foods

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic
compounds least aware like way tastes
provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,

supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

hubermanlab.com. also want touch back idea foods can increase
focus. know, episode ADHD did, touched quite bit
relates elimination diets. whole industry ton interest obvious
reasons sorts things kids adults shouldn't eat order
reduce symptoms ADHD. think sum total data point fact
reducing simple sugar intake certainly highly processed foods, ice cream, candy,
chips, et cetera, sorts things, really seem improve symptoms ADHD


children adults. move past start say, well,
foods can improve concentration focus? Well, foods instance include
lot tyrosine, precursor dopamine, now know dopamine
important context, certainly going increase concentration focus.
things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts, can look foods
contain high amounts tyrosine. also fruits vegetables include
high amounts tyrosine, quite direct, doesn't matter whether not
ingesting foods rich precursor amino acids dopamine, acetylcholine, et
cetera, consuming large amounts foods. one can look see
instance, steak includes lot precursors acetylcholine. amino
acid precursors dopamine well foods will well,
ingest say two ribeye steaks, lot meat will direct lot
blood gut will cause sleepy will create challenges
able achieve states focus concentration. simple way put
eat much eat large volume food, going diminish
focus concentration. key eat enough nourished
certain activities, mental physical need perform,

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic
compounds least aware like way tastes
provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research

caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

children adults. move past start say, well,
foods can improve concentration focus? Well, foods instance include
lot tyrosine, precursor dopamine, now know dopamine
important context, certainly going increase concentration focus.
things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts, can look foods
contain high amounts tyrosine. also fruits vegetables include
high amounts tyrosine, quite direct, doesn't matter whether not
ingesting foods rich precursor amino acids dopamine, acetylcholine, et
cetera, consuming large amounts foods. one can look see
instance, steak includes lot precursors acetylcholine. amino
acid precursors dopamine well foods will well,
ingest say two ribeye steaks, lot meat will direct lot
blood gut will cause sleepy will create challenges
able achieve states focus concentration. simple way put
eat much eat large volume food, going diminish
focus concentration. key eat enough nourished
certain activities, mental physical need perform,

00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness

eating large meals, going diminish concentration focus
period. know many people curious whether not caffeine can improve focus
concentration, indeed can. immense amount data supporting
idea caffeine, provided consumed appropriate dosages, can improve
mental performance physical performance, largely
improvements focus concentration. dosage caffeine course, going
depend caffeine adapted are, much caffeine tolerance have.
going vary tremendously depending whether not ingest caffeine
without food, mentioned earlier. kind general range
can talk caffeine useful focus concentration. range
basically 100 milligrams 400 milligrams. want caution everybody there,
somebody suffers anxiety panic attacks, not used
ingesting caffeine run ingest 400 milligrams caffeine form
espresso yerba mate energy drink pill form, going


uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic
compounds least aware like way tastes
provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going

weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

uncomfortable you, going sweating profusely, heart rate going
increase, going quite panicked fact least anxious. cautious
use adopting caffeine not already caffeine adapted,
people quite well ingest 100 200 milligrams caffeine prior
focused work. again, recommend delaying caffeine intake 90 120
minutes waking, unless using caffeine really jolt system
workout. Caffeine can course ingested various forms, even pill form,
people ingest form coffee particular favorite way ingest caffeine
yerba mate. important note actively avoid smoked
versions yerba mate contain lot carcinogenic, cancer promoting
compounds. great yerba mate brands there. cost effective
way consume use loose leaf tea pour water that.
one particular brand like, don't affiliation whatsoever,
using years, Anna Park. organic brand sold, buy mine
Amazon, can find elsewhere internet well. Again, don't
affiliation them, just cost effective, clean, doesn't smoked
flavor, least one buy not smoked variety none carcinogenic
compounds least aware like way tastes
provides even lift stimulant think certainly works
number people know suggested also enjoy. Yerba mate caffeine
also additional benefits, particular, caffeine yerba mate coffee
sources caffeine known increase density efficacy,
number function dopamine receptors, shown humans
several times. ingesting caffeine pretty regularly, actually increasing
ability dopamine effect increasing motivation drive. tend ingest
caffeine early day, tend cut off caffeine intake somewhere around one
2:00 PM ensure can get good night's sleep, realize
people ingest caffeine late two three afternoon can still
sleep fine. will caution think can drink caffeine evening
nighttime still fall asleep. research points fact architecture
sleep depth sleep disrupted. Even able fall stay
asleep, sleep getting simply not good sleep get
shut off caffeine intake least eight hours bedtime, ideally
like 10 even 12 hours bedtime. course, practical


constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

constraints well. Okay caffeine increasing dopamine's function changing
number efficacy dopamine receptors, course, also increases
wakefulness, alertness, largely neurochemical systems
related adenosine, molecule builds brain body longer
awake, part sleepiness system will, makes us feel fatigued
tired, caffeine also operates epinephrine, adrenaline system. fact,
ingest much caffeine, sometimes get jitters. jitters really
sympathetic, called, nervous system's bias toward movement, pupils will
dilate, actually get broader. Now somewhat paradoxically, pupils get
bigger, pupils eyes is, visual world actually narrows, becomes
tunnel-like. lot people don't realize this. pupils really small, means
relaxed. ever see someone really tiny pin size pupils,
relaxed. pupils big, dilated, well
amped up, very, alert. Caffeine increases alertness increasing
epinephrine, adrenaline release brain within body.

00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration

another way facilitates focus concentration. Now
ways increase epinephrine brain body besides caffeine stimulants,
fact, studied. excellent study carried not
long ago stress can increase ability focus concentrate,
right stress can increase focus concentration. know, people
think stress impairing ability focus, actually not true.
stressed, involves deployment, release adrenaline, epinephrine,
adrenaline changes visual field, words, narrows vision
tunnel-like focus, makes arrow metaphor arrow
sharp, improves concentration. makes sense given know
stress. stressed, tend stressed specific thing,
start anticipating wondering thinking going happen next? led
this? going impact me? feel right now? really narrows
context thinking behavior. one favorite studies really
illustrates stress can improve concentration performance one
published not long ago will provide link show notes. paper


published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea

maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental

continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal

published "Journal Experimental Psychology" 2020. title paper is,
not surprisingly, "Acute stress improves concentration performance", first author
DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e. study involved taking number subjects
stressing not prior cognitive concentration task. lot
data paper, just going hone one specific set data.
mention go there, measured things like cortisol, stress hormone,
measured anxiety, quite thorough study. found
concentration performance improved manyfold, say, from, greater
doubling concentration performance stress group. stress
context provided using standard way inducing stress. basically
bring subjects laboratory either something fairly
mundane control group simulated job interview, arithmetic
task, evaluated this. isn't intense psychosocial
stress. not watching anything disturbing, not traumatized
kind way. fairly low levels stress raised levels epinephrine,
know study, levels cortisol, another stress hormone,
modestly within brain blood. even modest increase stress
hormones reported psychological levels stress really enhanced focus
concentration. may come surprising 'cause like many people think, gosh,
stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine

absolutely wrong, stress improves cognitive performance. Now course
ways increase stress levels healthy ways improve
concentration performance one best ways sure
fire generally safe provided safely deliberate cold exposure.
something talked podcast before, deliberate cold exposure can
achieved getting cold shower one five minutes. not used it,
probably want start one minute, can get ice bath,
nowadays number different commercial sources circulating cold water
access body cold water like lake pool ocean. know
getting cold water cold water greatly increases epinephrine levels
dopamine levels brain blood. beautiful study published


European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

European Journal Physiology showed increases dopamine
massive, near doubling dopamine levels long lasting hours,
epinephrine, indeed cortisol levels also increased, ways support
not just immune system function that, mood that,
can really improve concentration focus. touched little bit
episode memory age old practice really dating back medieval
times putting people cold water right learn something order spike,
increase epinephrine way consolidate memories. sake
today's discussion, interested ways improve focus concentration,
need increase epinephrine, adrenaline levels. Cold water exposure one
efficient ways that. not biohack. don't like word hack, know
commonly used, hack something using one thing different
purpose originally intended here, not referring shower
cold bath, referring epinephrine. Epinephrine neurochemical will place
vision tunnel mode, will allow focus cognitive work
physical work specific way, not going distractable,
easy achieve getting cold shower cold body water brief period
time. People always ask long get cold water cold make
it. thing, uncomfortably cold, safe stay one five
minutes. Okay uncomfortably cold, really want get out, safe stay in, not
cold going give heart attack not warm comfortable
doesn't create adrenaline release. Cold water exposure, say
deliberate, cold water non deliberate cold water exposure reliably increases
epinephrine levels. incredibly useful tool this, fact, zero cost
even negative zero cost. negative zero cost? Well, can certainly
save heating bill taking cold shower one way.
access devices locations can get cold water, can
submerge, well can work. don't, maybe take cold
bath, get neck, going efficient.
can't that, get cold shower. Again, comfortably cold
point want get out, can safely stay one five minutes.
long workout? Well, get really cold water,
uncomfortably cold get three minutes, probably good go,
dry off get work. might think little bit silly tool focus


concentration, look data epinephrine powerfully can
increase focus, think impressed. mean certainly can increase one's
ability attend specific visual stimuli, reading math work, et cetera, going
useful. course don't want make cold shivering
chattering whole time. course could, like, combine 40
HZ binaural beats, no reason couldn't combine two protocols.
point lot people love think leverage
health promoting powerful effects increasing epinephrine focusing
concentration running getting stressed life event getting
argument something like simply way increase focus concentration
doesn't seem adaptive me. deliberate cold exposure straightforward way
that, doesn't involve anyone else, suppose somebody else,
doesn't require anyone else. again, zero low even negative cost
ways approach that. like know long positive effects epinephrine
last toward improving focus concentration, well, look study
DeGroote et al, acute stress improves cognitive performance study, measured
concentration 30 minutes stress induced
appear quite long lasting,

01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Protocols

really hour effect increasing epinephrine. might apply
sorts protocols early day later day? Well, one suggestion one
potential protocol going sit work,
already feeling alert focused, no need reach tool, feeling like
focus alertness isn't quite like be, take three
minute cold shower submerge cold water three minutes, might
cup coffee well sit work, maybe even throw
40 HZ binaural beats. layering different systems,
different neurochemicals, acetylcholine, epinephrine dopamine,

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability Refocus

going lend really terrific 90 minute less work about. Now


like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft

talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk

like discuss purely behavioral tools quality peer reviewed science say
can improve focus concentration significantly. beginning today's episode,
talked study Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab explored 13 minute
meditation done every day period eight weeks. meditation led significant
improvements focus concentration ability, well aspects cognitive
performance. also improved mood reduced stress. might wondering
exactly meditation? meditation simple one anyone
can perform. want set timer 13 minutes, don't think
exactly 13 minutes, since included study,
set timer 13 minutes. sit lie down, close eyes,
simply focus breathing. people going benefit
breathing nose, sort obstruction inability
breathe just nose, probably also breathing
nose mouth just mouth. ideally just nasal breathing
period 13 minutes, concentrating breathing, concentrating, meaning
bringing awareness, so-called interoceptive awareness wanted get
really technical it, interoceptive awareness point just inch inside
forehead. Now, course, might sound kind gory you,
never actually inside forehead, just inch behind forehead
want place concentration also concentrating
breathing. Now thing meditation studies meditation show,
unless experienced meditator, concentration,
focus will drift away breathing away location inch inside
head, inside brain, just behind forehead. will happen maybe
every 10 seconds, every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds, important
part meditation practice improve concentration focus
continually refocusing back specific location refocusing back breath.
something again, not often discussed. People think
meditation supposed concentrate breath, mind drifts
somehow failed meditation, actually not case. huge
component improving ability focus concentrate way neuroplasticity,
rewiring circuits focus concentration, repeated return state
focus state non-focus diminished focus. think like trying drive
freeway staying lane lines, excuse me. every


while, bit drift vehicle, maybe wheels aren't aligned
correctly something else wrong chassis steering device, starts
drift right little bit, hit rumble strip go rrrr, pull back
center. really focused meditation practice opposed
expecting stay mental lane lines, speak.
somebody going practice sort described, 13 minute meditation
practice every day, want sit lie down, close eyes, start concentrate
breath, focus attention location inch behind forehead,
fully expect point, thinking something else,
cue focus back location just inch behind forehead back
breath. repeatedly over, really training
network within brain indeed includes prefrontal cortex focusing
well structures, inferior temporal cortex, indeed
hippocampus, structure associated memory, components neural
circuit involved directing mental focus concentration. Again, can't
emphasize importance practice one focusing refocusing. fact,
prefer call practice, refocus focused meditation, constantly
refocusing, maybe can come better name it, certainly not
good naming things, sort meditation practice shown study
Suzuki lab studies really improve people's ability focus remain
focused, much beautiful book, "Altered States," describe number
different meditation practices, little bit longer one described,
one 17 minutes, another one 30 minutes, people will meditate long
60 minutes day, although quite long time, opinion. point isn't
long focus somehow trying achieve total focus entire 13 minute
17 minute 60 minute meditation. wonderful think
many people aspire that, lot hard mental work. think people
there, including myself, relatively short meditation practice 13 minutes
fully expect focus concentration drift, continually
refocusing going effective, yes, indeed, effective teaching
focus stay concentrated. fact, invite interpret every time
focus off location one inch behind forehead, opportunity
refocus think refocusing trigger teaching neural circuits
focus extended periods time. bonus sort meditation


practice, study Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed people experience
improvements sleep improvements memory, not just improvements mood
reduction stress improvements focus concentration,
positive benefits just 13 minute day meditation practice. one
started adopt felt tremendous benefit encourage many
try well. one cautionary note one mentioned beginning
episode, refocus call it, meditation, involve
significant amount effort engagement prefrontal cortical circuits,
disruptive sleep performed closely sleep. going
practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find
scripts zero cost multiple places. can find certain apps
NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go
day. afternoon, fatigued lack sleep, might
another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging

another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking

cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated

practice,

01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods

recommend not within four hours prior bedtime. Earlier
mentioned talk ways improve focus sleep deprived.
something familiar with. put lot effort optimizing sleep,
something passing year, put effort into, again,
sleep vital mental health, physical health performance kinds,
certainly role student, role professor role life,
numerous times simply not get enough sleep sleep terrible
whatever reason, yet still work demands social demands, et cetera.
One practice effective allowing focus better
otherwise conditions sleep deprivation called non-sleep deep rest
NSDR. also referred sometimes yoga nidra. Yoga nidra actually means
yoga sleep. Yoga nidra practice lying 10 30 sometimes even
long 60 minutes, listen script, audio script, takes
progressive deep relaxation, involves body scan, long exhale breathing.
restorative sense one tends emerge yoga nidra NSDR feeling
greatly refreshed compared felt prior it. also terrific neuroimaging
data laboratories Denmark showing restoration dopamine levels
so-called basal ganglia NSDR AKA yoga nidra. Whether not call
yoga nidra NSDR, refer as, non-sleep deep rest, can find

NSDR yoga nidra apps. NSDR protocol put Madefor


YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,
try find quiet place can NSDR 30 ideally 60
minutes. Sometimes will fall back asleep NSDR, fine that,
people will stay awake NSDR, emerge go

another NSDR 10 30 60 minutes, another work about. Again, NSDR
something every day. talked lot episodes related sleep,
can help get better falling staying asleep night addition
feeling restorative immediate timeframe day NSDR,
immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition

fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,

concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study

obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts

model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated

YouTube can access free. NSDR say
number NSDR protocols Virtusan app. are, again, number
different places one can access NSDR protocols. NSDR 10 30 minutes
per day every single day, not just days sleep deprived. happen
sleep deprived, extend NSDR 30 60 minutes.
NSDR will depend time NSDR. haven't slept well,

immensely beneficial various times various purposes. within
context trying concentrate focus sleep deprived, NSDR, AKA yoga
nidra immensely beneficial practice. growing amounts quality science
pointing neurochemical replenishing effects, mentioned before, dopamine,
also potential NSDR replace sleep lost. never want anyone
try use NSDR total replacement sleep, conditions
cannot control sleep, NSDR going best way aware
restore ability focus concentrate whatever purpose. emerge
NSDR drink caffeine, notice even greater capacity
focus concentration reasons directly related caffeine. again, NSDR
general tool enhancing ability sleep tool can use
order compensate for, least degree, compensate lost sleep
need focus concentrate. One thing really contrasts NSDR yoga nidra
sort focused meditation talked minutes ago, 13 minute
meditation, 13 minute meditation, actively trying refocus
focus, whereas NSDR yoga nidra, actually trying defocus.
can think 13 minute meditation refocusing focusing directly tapping
mediating improvements circuitry focus concentration whereas
can think NSDR yoga nidra



01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular

suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved

monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found

model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely

01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States

modulating brain body state allow focus concentrate better.
Now another tool can use directly tap circuits focus
concentration greatly accelerate neuroplasticity, improvements,
say changes circuits will allow focus concentrate better
hypnosis. lot people hear hypnosis think stage hypnosis, know, people
squawking like chickens things will, actually hypnosis
atypical highly accessible brain state studied lot rigor Stanford
University School Medicine colleague, Dr. David Spiegel, guest
podcast previously. Hypnosis unique brain state one
deeply focused yet deeply relaxed. just sort set array practices
can think logically, focus refocus meditation based
focused focus, no pun intended. NSDR yoga nidra aimed deep relaxation.
Hypnosis atypical, powerful brain state combine high levels
focus deep relaxation. Now little bit tough one just take oneself into,
fortunately, tool based lot quality peer-reviewed research
Spiegel lab labs Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i. Reveri app
available no cost, least period time think place certain
elements behind pay wall, can try zero cost, available Apple,
soon think also available Android, specific hypnosis protocols
listen to, brief protocols, follow instructions,
listening particular audio script David Spiegel himself, progressive
breathing actually eye movements directly linked neural circuits
allow highly focused, deeply relaxed states. components
within Reveri app specifically geared towards improving focus concentration.
again, meditation focus, deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
take deep relaxation, hypnosis special, directed
state highly focused highly relaxed, say deeply relaxed, allow
access neural circuits focus concentration allow tune
improve significantly brief amount time. again,
hypnosis scripts short eight minutes, long 13 minutes.
really talking zero cost tools directly tap neural
circuits, components within brain, allow deep relaxation, allow deep


focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus

focus, improve ability focus concentrate time simply repeating
these. often need repeat Reveri hypnosis focus concentration
see benefits? Well, will vary person person. tend use
every third fourth day experienced tremendous benefits it. don't think
unique sense, lot data support Reveri app
protocols within it. long NSDR experience
benefits? There, say first time every time, deeply relaxing
emerge feeling quite restored relative went it.
mentioned earlier study meditation, took eight weeks see effects
observed study, didn't observe shorter time points. highly
encourage people explore meditation geared towards focus refocus, also NSDR,
nonsleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, Reveri app, Specifically hypnosis
within Reveri app, geared towards improving focus concentration.
terrific science support them, not woo science hacks just
something people came with. grounded work best
universities world, excellent groups who've looked underlying neural
mechanisms measured things lot rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:07 Optimal Time Day Use Specific Tools

tools available you, highly recommend use them.
interested optimal time day these, already mentioned focus
refocus meditation shouldn't done close sleep, Reveri hypnosis app can
done time really, fact, component falling back sleep there,
words, hypnosis specifically geared toward helping people teach
fall back asleep wake middle night. NSDR, always say, can
done first thing morning, afternoon time day, fact,
sometimes middle night happen wake need get back
sleep. really tools can applied time day, except one
caveat

01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze

focus refocus meditation not done close sleep. Now


another set behavioral tools can really help enhance one's ability focus
visual based tools. fact, tools describe actually
employed number schools China elsewhere order teach children
focus better longer periods time. key principle much
cognitive focus, ability think something specific way stay
focused it, read follow line conversation math music, et cetera,
going directed visual system. visual system two forms attention
focus. One overt focus, straightforward. looking tip
pen, listening right now, looking tip pen, overt
focus, focusing eyes, course, rest brain will follow
start analyze details seeing contours pen, et cetera.
seems sort obvious first hear it, cognitive focus tends follow
overt visual focus. also put blinders horses. also
sometimes wearing hoodie hat limiting visual field way can help
enhance cognitive focus, can help limit distraction. just not seeing
much. also ingest caffeine kind stimulant stressed
pupils dilate vision becomes tunnel-like, less panoramic,
tunnel-like, know say soda straw view world looking
tunnel, focus, visual focus actually driving cognitive focus.
cognitive focus narrower seeing whole scene
in. hear this, sounds obvious, many people, including many
scientists, just not obvious case. However, case,
visual focus drives cognitive focus. practice studied
various laboratories employed various schools? children
adults visually focus one location given period time. long? Anywhere
30 seconds three minutes, believe not, three minutes long time
maintain visual focus one location. try right now, probably find
bit strain, want try it, can. Keep mind, yes,
allowed blink, also keep mind meditation refocusing practice talked
earlier, refocusing key component teaching brain,
brain, brain you, teach focus better.
going incorporate practice, want pick location,
wall, computer front you, although
encourage not contents computer screen, might just want


blank screen, might want put piece paper crosshatch there,
sort visual target, can imagine visual target focus visual
attention target try breathe normally, try stay relaxed, certainly
allow blink eyes don't try out. not test long
can go without blinking. focusing particular location forcing
refocus location anytime gaze, vision drifts location,
encouraging circuits focus get better focusing longer longer
refocusing focus drifts off location. incorporating neural circuits,
including prefrontal cortex, things like frontal eye fields. curious
underlying biology, practice recruiting certain elements so-called
prefrontal cortex, also frontal eye fields, locations not far
prefrontal cortex, involved deliberately directing gaze particular
locations space, not outer space, although focusing stars
suppose, visual space. Now mentioned

01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work

overt visual focus attention, overtly looking location,
one also powerful practice improving focus concentration use covert
focus. Covert focus gaze, eyes focused one location,
pen, focus actually directed elsewhere room location in.
mind extent peripheral vision focused case door just
left room in. takes little bit effort. something
old world primates, old world primates, able do. probably
evolved part mechanism animals evaluate scene, evaluate
predators, evaluate primates not necessarily staring directly
can obtain information, can obtain information without direct gaze
specifically one location. Maybe can obtain information multiple locations,
indeed, can. Without getting far rabbit hole vision cognition
relate, done episodes previously, simply focusing
tools can incorporated improve focus concentration,
recommend. Set low bar first set timer try focus one
location 30 seconds day. next day, might add five
seconds, next day, five seconds that. miss day, no big deal,


simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really
homing location physically. practice lot athletes use
fact, say musical practice math, well then, want focus
something task trying perform. again, using visual focus
way ramp increase overall ability focus concentrate,

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.
wonderful site. mentioned several times podcast.

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting

milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500

don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold

supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior

simply practice amount time last time
practice, gradually try increase amount time can focus
one visual location overtly looking directly location. like,
feel ability, can try covert attention focus
looking straight forward instance, attending something corner
room trying 30 seconds, find quite bit harder,
extending five seconds every time practice. something
don't think necessarily build able full hour
order extract benefits. fact, best way think practice
means get focused state. remember back hour ago,
talking focused states not drop way exit type
phenomenon. don't just drop focused state way don't drop
peak performance workout, warm up. recommend 30
second three minute period beginning focus going
work physical work anchoring vision one location somewhere
room want covertly, can that, setting timer trying
anywhere 30 seconds three minutes. exercise
practice ramping neural activity within neural circuits create
focus concentration. Then, stop looking location covert
location move work trying do, either mental work
physical work. halfway 90 minute point
90 minute work exercise, feel concentration drifting
rather look phone scroll thousands contexts exists
within social media phone, try just picking location wall, focusing
back location, using ramp direct focus back towards,
weight training, sets reps might performing, running,
might this, cycling might focusing particular location really

01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids



applying whatever trying learn perform. Next, like
talk compounds can improve concentration focus,
often consumed supplements, although them, mention, can also
derived food. Again, just want remind things, case
compounds, can modulate biological mechanism, can modulate focus
concentration, compounds can mediate, can directly contribute
concentration focus. One key compounds supports concentration
focus generally supports mood, concentration focus brain function
general omega-3 essential fatty acids. talked omega-3 essential
fatty acids variety contexts, particular depression, also ADHD,
interesting data that, really clear getting somewhere one
three grams EPA, one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day can
improve outcomes, can improve mood can improve cognitive function.
debate whether not can improve cardiac function,
clear, least me, ingesting one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per
day beneficial. again, context focus concentration, modulating
neural circuits brain function going support focus concentration.
not taking one three grams EPA essential fatty acid per day going tap
directly circuits focus concentration. said, discussed
episode Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Rhonda Patrick, episode
ADHD did, episode depression did, make point
ingest one three grams EPAs per day. can get EPAs sources
besides supplements, course, supplements going easiest way
that. liquid form, fish oil, cod liver oil, people
vegan opt sources EPAs, can find certainly.
people even use prescription EPAs get dosage really high. Dr. Ronda Patrick
talked episode me, actually something does. don't
take prescription form, get pill form supplement affiliate,
Momentous, number different quality sources EPAs
there. quality sources also include things like fatty fish, algae,
things sort. leave whether not supplement omega-
3 fatty acids order get one three grams per day whether not
food, encourage try reach threshold



01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.

01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate

number known positive effects mood brain function
generally. thing can positively modulate brain function actually
works fuel neurons function can improve cognitive performance,
particularly within brain circuits, prefrontal cortex, involved
concentration focus creatine. know many people familiar creatine
monohydrate effects muscle growth strength performance,
quite clear bulk scientific studies examined role creatine
clinical context role improving cognitive performance. read
literature led practice ingest five grams per day creatine
monohydrate, sort standard form available in, generally available
powder, certainly take it. take creatine powder, mix water
Athletic Greens sort electrolyte drink, whatever liquid happens
convenient ingest in, time day doesn't really seem important.
people strong believers consuming creatine post-workout. might
beneficial, simply take morning post-workout, sort depends
remember take it, five grams creatine per day, case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth strength performance much geared toward
tapping creatine phosphate system within brain specifically benefits
creatine prefrontal cortical networks, again, modulating, not directly mediating,
modulating generally supporting brain networks going allow
generate focus concentration. much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
creatine monohydrate five grams day

01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk Stroke? & Garlic

seems generally support brain function, will generally support concentration
focus. Now terms compounds specifically mediate concentration
focus, go back arrow metaphor model talked
beginning episode, included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
acts attentional spotlight, fact, acetylcholine elevated levels
acetylcholine shown beautiful work Mike
Merzenich's lab UCSF Kilgard Lab Houston, number


labs, including Norm Weinberger's lab UC Irvine, again, improve even
directly gate neuroplasticity increasing focus directly. lot word soup,
basically happens acetylcholine transmission increased even transiently
within brain, greater opportunity neuroplasticity take place.
reason greater opportunity neuroplasticity, AKA learning take place,
way increased focus spiking acetylcholine can provide. mentioned earlier,
number different foods contain choline, can look
online, choline acting amino acid precursor acetylcholine, course,
compounds, supplements can acutely increase
acetylcholine, indeed, use myself. effective one found
Alpha-GPC. Alpha-GPC consumed dosages 300 milligrams 600 milligrams prior
work prior workout greatly increase one's ability focus
concentrate, least experience, good data
humans. use Alpha-GPC? use Alpha-GPC taking 10
20 minutes prior time want focus concentrate deeply. taken
much 600 milligrams one time, although find 300 milligrams enough me,
tend quite sensitive supplements caffeine general, sometimes
take alongside yerba mate yerba mate coffee prior workout prior
work focusing mental work. reading, writing,
math, data analysis, anything need lot focus
concentration. Now number people contacted recent study
suggesting Alpha-GPC taken chronically many years increase
one's vulnerability stroke. looked data read data
not conclusive, although anytime see something like that, study
pointing fact given compound might increase propensity stroke,
obviously want concerned. ask how, mechanism
is, Alpha-GPC increasing susceptibility stroke? seems
related increases TMAO, marker related cardiovascular system.
one known way offset increases TMAO associated either Alpha-
GPC increases due things, ingestion particular food compounds actually
can increase TMAO, offset taking 600 milligrams garlic. Now
taking Alpha-GPC pretty consistently number years. not take every day.
say take four days per week, again, prior workouts bouts
cognitive work. not seen TMAO spike evaluated way blood


tests, nonetheless, take 600 milligrams garlic capsule form anytime eat
anyway general cardiovascular function interesting
data immune system function, et cetera garlic. consuming 600
milligram capsules garlic period time. days, ingest just one 600
milligram capsule, times, take two, based recent study
concerns TMAO, make point always ingest 600 milligram capsule
garlic anytime take Alpha-GPC, four days per week.
model attention focus, can now clearly see taking Alpha-GPC,
increases acetylcholine transmission beneficial concentration focus
taking double espresso taking yerba mate
increase concentration focus mentioned earlier, caffeine going
increase epinephrine. also going increase density dopamine receptors
Alpha-GPC going increase acetylcholine, spotlighting cognition,
ability really amplify activity specific neural networks, largely
happening

01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food

trying focus pay attention something specifically. one wants
increase amount dopamine transmission brain body sake
increasing concentration focus, one efficient ways
ingestion amino acid L-tyrosine. Again, L-tyrosine can derived food
sources, invite look various food sources web, simply go
web browser put foods contain lot L-tyrosine get rich array
choices select from. case, use L-tyrosine capsule form. will take 500
milligrams L-tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee. careful
early day, certainly not two 3:00 PM don't want
diminish ability fall stay asleep night. early day
workout concentrated mental work. Again, tend
four days per week,

01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability

certainly not every time sit work. also mention still


tend behavioral tools. tend use five minutes binaural beats binaural
beats throughout work session, sometimes ice bath cold shower before.
don't want give impression combine every tool talked today
given workout. mean, pretty wild take cold shower, pop L-
tyrosine, take Alpha-GPC, drink two espresso, listen binaural beats.
seems like inefficient way go life. fact, make point try use
tools increase ability concentrate focus, not combine two
three one time. say two three, mean will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine caffeine together certain work
bouts, might use visual practice focusing given location minute
begin work about, might combine those. another time might take cold
shower prior work. days, confess, slept well
enthusiasm work don't require
tools. Again, no requirement, no pressure use tools,
behavioral, supplement based otherwise. simply matter using tools
going allow achieve states want achieve improve
ability go states without help all. find particularly
attractive supplements. not much put ideal state
work accomplish work always rely
supplements. prefer look supplements sort just described route
deeper trench focus concentration use tool teach
focus concentrate deeply, don't need tools every single time
try focus concentrate. think important point think many
people think supplements

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft
arrowhead thinking focus, acetylcholine, arrowhead itself,
dopamine, sort propeller behind arrow allows
continually drive forward mental physical work.

01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced
Dosage

crutch way simply getting state no tool will suffice
replace. context, want remind larger context pharmacology,
vast landscape prescription pharmacology ADHD, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Now covered landscape intense detail episode
ADHD focus. just summarize, course, Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil, number different compounds, generally increase


dopamine transmission brain, increasing dopamine, generally
increase epinephrine, adrenaline transmission brain body. many
compounds tremendous benefit children even adults
suffer ADHD. properly prescribed appropriate dosage, compounds
can really help people clinically diagnosed ADHD. way help people
bit surprising, however. might think, well turn brain chemicals
allow people concentrate focus. true, also benefit
teaching brain circuits engage. one reasons
somewhat paradoxically giving stimulant like Ritalin Adderall kid
legitimately needs it, obviously, don't want without oversight
careful evaluation psychiatrist, giving kid severe ADHD,
think make rambunctious, less able focus
distractible overall. all, Ritalin, Modafinil, Armodafinil, things
stimulants. take kid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder give
drugs increase transmission dopamine epinephrine
think, wow, going make even distractible hyperactive indeed,
opposite effect. doesn't necessarily make feel calm, makes
feel can focus, really can anchor attention. idea
teaching neural circuits neural circuits rather teaching
engage focus concentrate. ideal situation one total
dosage compounds, drugs, can reduced time circuits
learn come online purely behavioral tools. Now oftentimes,
maintenance drugs long periods time, although common
practice nowadays trying diminish dosage overall.

01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency

context ADHD prescription medication acknowledge lot,
indeed 80% college students say statistics using prescription drugs
not fact prescribed prescription drugs. basically
saying lot people using drugs designed ADHD narcolepsy
drugs will effectively increase focus concentration, strongly
discourage use powerful prescription drugs not prescribed you.
First all, illegal. Second all, quite dangerous hit accelerator


neural circuits vigor can increase dependency can
number side effects outside context clinically diagnosed prescribed
ADHD medication. context supplementation, increase dopamine,
acetylcholine epinephrine one can achieve say 500 milligrams L-
tyrosine, 300 milligrams Alpha-GPC cup coffee going substantially
less one see prescription drugs. getting modest effect
can similarly teach brain circuits focus concentration engage better.
general backdrop this, always say say
probably day die, hopefully long time now, regardless, it'll
message, always believe behavioral tools come first,
behavioral tools come first. focus nutrition. fact, say
behavioral nutrition tools, course, get excellent sleep. focus
supplementation then, failing bring brain body
state need perform well school work life, et cetera
recommend people lean prescription drugs. Now caveat that,
conditions like severe eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder, depression people truly risk suicide severe mental
health effects behavioral health effects really at, lives risk
overall mood wellbeing risk, often case people cannot access
brain states required shift purely behavioral tools, nutrition, et
cetera. again, typical person not suffering one psychiatric
disorders mentioned psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
strongly encourage look behavioral tools first, nutrition, supplementation,
remaining need, prescription drugs. contrasts
much typical scenario hear days college students
people will say, oh yeah, hear drug, Ritalin Vyvanse can
immediately put state heightened focus concentration. Now listen,
ADHD, means, talk physician, talk great psychiatrist figure
whether not right you. don't, again, behavioral tools, nutrition,
supplementation, particular, behavioral tools going ones
going allow teach neural circuits focus concentrate better,
cannot overstate importance that, behavioral tools,
extent supplementation combined behavioral tools really allow train
neural circuits can focus concentrate



01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine

depth degree duration going best serve mental
physical goals. Now one compound used time time
continue use order increase focus concentration will use
combination supplements talked
phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine dopamine synthesis pathway,
increases dopamine transmission tends function little bit differently L-
tyrosine. every while, swap L-tyrosine put 500 milligrams
phenylethylamine sometimes, really want push little bit harder
dopamine system, going long intense work, will take
300 milligrams Alpha-GPC, 500 milligrams L-tyrosine, generally take
caffeine, mention, don't go past 100 200 milligrams
caffeine 'cause don't really like feeling jittery, not really goal, goal
alert, not alert really can't focus anything, not interested
anxiety attack all, sometimes either swap will add 500
milligrams phenylethylamine. Phenylethylamine PEA pathway. talked
previous podcast dopamine motivation drive, short-
lived compound. tend take beginning workout
sometimes middle workout, take another 500 milligram capsule.
just described combining compounds, Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine caffeine, fairly rare occurrence combine four
really conditions intensely challenging
mental physical work. say frequency combine four
things probably every two weeks, typically like month,
careful early part day,

01:44:50 Tool: Supplements Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine

certainly noon hour, no way going disrupt sleep. realize
many probably wondering hoping discuss things like lions
mane racetams compounds known powerfully
modulate dopamine, epinephrine acetylcholine systems. quite direct,


far many compounds review single episode,
generally tap set processes. Again, epinephrine, shaft

01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools Focus

encourage check out. Again, URL examine.com. today
talked number different tools extent, mechanisms involved
concentration focus, really goal provide
understanding neurochemical systems little bit neurocircuits
can allow achieve states attention focus. contrast previous episodes
Huberman Lab Podcast, covered topics tremendous depth
relates mechanism also focused tools, today, largely focused tools.
talked behavioral tools, like meditation 13 minutes long done daily
specifically improve ability focus, fact, data support
will. talked hypnosis, talked visual focus, overt covert, talked
various supplements, Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,


supplements use directly modulate neural circuits concentration
focus. also talked creatine omega-3s. talked importance
sleep, modulates ability function mentally physically overall,
optimize sleep. talked number protocols can
incorporate. hope giving information one single location
able pick choose protocols like incorporate
attempts improve focus concentration. Again, don't recommend
protocols once. recommend picking handful them, maybe
one two, maybe three four, trying different combinations different
times day different purposes, mental work, physical work, et cetera,
find best you. again, goal teach brain, increase
neuroplasticity neural circuits allow not just focus, refocus
attention. remiss didn't mention also critical able defocus.
highly encourage people take period time day daydream, walk
hall without looking phone, not incorporate sensory
information, not place increasing demands focus, see realize
period deliberate decompression defocusing can allow brain
focus much better decide return focus, concentrated
work physical work.
