workspace optimization. topic intrigued long time
undergraduate advisor, graduate advisor postdoc advisor
many things common, including great scientists, kind people terrific
mentors, another thing common, always perplexed me,
offices complete disaster. mountains books, mountains
papers, mountains sorts stuff. yet extremely productive
remain extremely focused incredibly cluttered environment. Now
somebody doesn't like clutter, find hard focus cluttered environments.
indeed tremendous variation among people whether not can
remain focused whether not struggle focus physically cluttered
environments. no right wrong this, question ask
able focused? turns reason
able focused captured one single yet fundamental
variable workspace optimization. talk variable is. fact,
talk variables optimizing workspace things like
vision, things like light, things like noise room, whether not listen music
not, whether not use noise canceling headphones not. going talk
going way can optimize
workspace, regardless whether not home, whether not
road, et cetera. last thing ever want create situation


find optimal workspace, slave optimal
workspace. just not way world works. want goal
rather, will short checklist things can look to, anytime
sit work, can think underlying variables impact
brain body allow brain body get optimal state
order learn, order productive indeed move work bouts
relaxed

00:10:02 Lighting Work Phase 1

pleasureful way maintaining focus pursuing number
things doing. first variable want think terms workspace
optimization vision light. previous episode Huberman Lab Podcast,
devoted habits, talked importance dividing 24 hour day
three different phases. haven't heard episode, just
going briefly summarize described. time wake morning
six seven eight, sometimes nine hours later, brain unique
state. state high levels dopamine, neuromodulator, high levels
epinephrin, well hormones like cortisol forth. Without going biology
things, set brain state high alertness. true,
whether not indulge caffeine not. know say, oh, really don't
wake afternoon, much alert focused afternoon. will
talk phase 24 hour day moment. early part day
time day sake workspace optimization, brightly lit
environment can lend optimal work throughout day, not just early
phase. many episodes podcast, also emphasized
importance getting morning sunlight eyes within 30 60 minutes waking,
not often, now, again, will also mention important light
daytime environment brightly safely can. going work
early, call phase one portion day, want much light
indeed much overhead light shining safely possible. course
don't want bright glaring squint, et cetera, want
much light safely possible. can couple simple ways. One
environment, overhead lights, turn overhead


lights. special overhead lights setting alertness neurons
eyes, called melanopsin ganglion cells, fancy name. Melanopsin
ganglion cells mainly enriched lower half retinas eyes view
upper visual field. neurons send little wires area hypothalamus,
right roof mouth, creates state alertness. Now, early day,
want alert possible. phase one circadian cycle
best analytic detailed type work. going go aspects
workspace optimization important phase one, phase one, again,
within zero eight nine hours waking, bright lights environment,
particular overhead lights, going facilitate focus, going facilitate
release things like dopamine norepinephrine healthy amounts cortisol.
want happen early day variety reasons. instance, don't
want cortisol peak happen late day. actually associated
depression insomnia number things just don't want. one
things done workspace make sure wake
morning, go get sunlight. sun isn't out, turn many bright artificial
lights can manage tolerate, go get sunlight exposure. set
work overhead lights room on, well lights
front me. stimulate heightened levels focus release
neuromodulators mentioned before, dopamine, norepinephrine
epinephrine. Now way one low cost way having,
instance, desk lamp overhead lights. somebody wants
take next level, can purchase ring light, is, think
mainly made people selfie type videos, Instagram posts things
sort. Ring lights can pretty cost-effective, yet bright
sort bright blue light going optimally stimulate melanopsin ganglion
cells. people know will blue light bright LED desk front
them. indeed one these, don't use ring light, use light pad.
particular light pad use, bought Amazon. can mention brand, again,
no financial affiliation them, Artograph Lightpad designed drawing.
says 930 lux, Lux just measure brightness. place desk
front turn essentially throughout phase one day. Even
walk away desk, tend keep on, doesn't consume much energy.
way, constantly bombarded photons keep levels


alertness early part day majority focused
work. Again, don't need light pad, can use ring light, can simply use
kind lights might happen artificial lights.
can place desk near window, even better open window,
really fantastic. don't access that. say open window? Well,
turns sunlight going best stimulus waking brain
body melanopsin hypothalamus system. looking sunlight
window, 50 times less effective window open, mostly
windows filter lot wavelengths blue light essential
stimulating eyes wake-up signal. rests premise
need alert order work, particular focused work.
talked Habits episode, saying now, first phase
day, first seven eight nine hours day really time
neurochemistry primed getting amount focused kind challenging
work done lot precision detail required. want brightly light
work environment first phase, again, time wake up, try
get sunlight, even going get exercise things, want
get much bright light eyes

00:16:00 Lighting Work Phase 2

safely can want light work environment. Now
afternoon, starting nine continuing 16 hours waking,
want start dimming lights environment. Now don't want make dark
don't want get sleepy two o'clock afternoon, unless going
take brief nap, perfectly fine, long doesn't interfere
nighttime sleep. idea so-called phase two 24 hour cycle
nine 16 hours waking, want bring level lights bit.
say down, literally mean down. lights front fine,
overhead lights time not going optimal sorts neurochemical
states brain wants in. states referring shift
dopamine norepinephrine highest early day increases things like
serotonin neuromodulators put brain state better
creative endeavors abstract thinking. Now, soon see,


things can improve creative thinking abstract thinking. fact,
things can improve analytic thing, will talk those, things
distinct light, right now just focusing light. recommend
doing, personally will turn off overhead lights afternoon. not
completely dim, not completely dark, will start reduce amount overhead
light just simply keep light pad whatever lamps happen
using. Now, one thing haven't talked screen brightness. highly
individual, people different retinal sensitivities. mean everybody
differs terms bright can tolerate visual environment screen.
whether not sensitive light not, will depend lot factors.
eye color, indeed people darker color eyes generally can tolerate bright
light others. green eyes, very, sensitive light. outdoors
cafe something, table kind reflective properties sunny
day, can barely see person across table me, unless wearing
sunglasses. people, members family instance, dark brown
eyes can just sit conversation without need sunglasses
all. that's, tremendous variation there, one isn't healthy
advantageous necessarily, just understand never want environment
painful maintain looking whatever looking at.
something's painful look at, damaging eyes, want
protect eyes. Now, second phase day, since us working
indoors, even working outdoors, want try get amount light
reduced overall, particular, overhead light, also want start reducing
amount blue light exposed to. somewhere around four 5:00
pm, 12 hours awake 14 hours
awake, will turn off light pad start transition lights environment
yellows reds. Now, can't always this, friends actually
converted entire homes blue light early day red light late day,
really cool fantastic, haven't done that. cost
optimal terms optimizing productivity sleep forth, not feasible
lot people. simply switch using yellow lamps. will turn off
LED later afternoon, again, around four 5:00 pm, tend wake around
6:00 so, turn off. try also try dim screen
working can still manage see everything need see,


quite bit dimmer early day.

00:19:45 Lighting Work Phase 3

phase two day, want think light.
just mention, know people working middle
night, phase three, 17 24 hours waking. realize
shift workers people pulling nighters students, oftentimes
need awake studying middle night. I, somebody
years pull anywhere five 10 all-nighters per year. still pull
nighter now, again, deadlines forth. don't recommend it,
can avoid it, great, many people just simply sake shift work
impending deadlines procrastination above. going
work third phase circadian cycle, really want limit
amount bright light getting eyes just amount allows
work doing. get light eyes, brighter
that, going severely deplete melatonin levels. going
severely shift circadian clock effectively like traveling another time zone.
stay 3:00 6:00 2:00 4:00 working term
paper something sort, getting bright light eyes,
effectively flying six hours different time zone, least body
registers as. can really throw sleep metabolism number
things whack. Now exception this, really want
awake, can often beneficial flipping lights room keeping
really bright. One hardest things stay night studying
dim environment. determine trade off whether
not want shift clock whether not want get work done.
say ideal situation sleep night work day
afternoon, awake middle night, understand
want dim lights overall. not want use LED,
not want overhead lights on, unless really struggling stay awake,
case want get many bright lights possible. couple
tricks all-nighters, don't really want people pulling all-nighters unless to,
things can without taking stimulants order stay


night, can beneficial maximize biology. One little
less commonly known can drink 32 ounces water commit not going
bathroom 90 minutes, least. turns circuit goes
bladder, literally neurons go bladder brainstem
urinate, makes alert. many probably experienced,
actually wakes us middle night use
bathroom circuit alertness goes full bladder, signaled
bladder full brainstem. circuit disrupted kids
bedwetting issues. number cognitive behavioral approaches
that, sometimes bedwetting young kids circuit hasn't developed
yet. adults fortunately not bedwetting, can increase amount
alertness system remain awake middle night, drinking little
bit water normally refraining going restroom,
certainly will lend alertness. know difficult fall asleep
use restroom instance. one tool. thing again,
flip many bright lights environment possible. course, people
will rely stimulants like caffeine even aggressive stimulants. not
something necessarily recommend, determine you.
fact, use all-nighters reason, can maximize bladder
brain approach right light approach. less covers bright
keep overall environment bright keep screen. really want
get nerdy this, free app called Light Meter can start
measuring many lux, many photons given environment. actually
measuring reflectance photons on, can look Lux Meter does,
like, don't necessarily recommend that. don't want set critical threshold
which, instance, say, environment 1,500 lux,
bright not bright enough, et cetera. Everyone different retinal sensitivities,
everyone will find different levels brightness will cause alert, different
levels dimness, will, room will cause feel sleepy. really want
just modulate across 24 hour cycle bright, bright safely can
early day alert. can focus detailed work first
phase, afternoon, move creative type works abstract
thinking, working people kind brainstorming mode



00:24:17 Look Work

shift dimmer lights, yellow lights, eliminate blue lights much
possible. Now light, another aspect vision shown
critically important alert going well can maintain
alertness. visual focus given environment.
not talking overall brightness, referring now simply
place phone tablet computer screen book, whatever

neurology relationship look level

can move eye socket side side down. also
muscles can actually pull eyeballs angles. different
muscles can move eyes different angles well, can look

neurons control muscles interesting feature,
looking toward ground anywhere below, basically central region

00:28:02 Arranging Environment

can exploited, indeed researched terms can used
optimize work environments. Contrary people do, look
laptop, tablet, phone, want alert want maintain
maximum amount focus whatever reading doing, want
screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus
neurons, release mention things like norepinephrin epinephrin,
neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling
desk forth little bit. sit, become little less active
lie indeed, time start get feet
waist head tilted back, neurons fire less neurons brain
involved calming, indeed putting sleep, start increasing level firing.
really beautiful system. beautiful, fact, studies show
adjust angle body back, actually get sort dose-dependent
increase sleepiness calmness dose-dependent decrease alertness.
so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,
front you, ideally you, things combine generate maximum
alertness. can think might work various aspects

today, talking workspace optimization. suppose also exploit
all-nighter trick talked earlier, actually this,
undergraduate, little bit masochistic way. drink coffee water
fairly high volume. wasn't forced drinking anything like that, actually wouldn't
allow get use bathroom except timer. think longest
ever went three half hours. kind excruciating, actually don't think
necessarily healthy advice, again, can use slight, mentioned slight
consumption fluids order generate alertness. just really trying get
much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use
restroom, found hard re-engage work



00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage
level depth focus like right off bat. timed
studies timed rigorous way, mine just call anecdata,
timed myself, studies looked this. data
point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly
short period time. However, can extend period time, talked
episode focus, importantly, sit start work
kind, kind expect take six minutes engage

assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six

lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones

tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture

vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside

people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system

certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put

subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles

again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal

10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even

well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,

time day sake workspace optimization, brightly lit
environment can lend optimal work throughout day, not just early
phase. many episodes podcast, also emphasized
importance getting morning sunlight eyes within 30 60 minutes waking,
not often, now, again, will also mention important light
daytime environment brightly safely can. going work
early, call phase one portion day, want much light
indeed much overhead light shining safely possible. course
don't want bright glaring squint, et cetera, want
much light safely possible. can couple simple ways. One

neuromodulators mentioned before, dopamine, norepinephrine
epinephrine. Now way one low cost way having,
instance, desk lamp overhead lights. somebody wants
take next level, can purchase ring light, is, think
mainly made people selfie type videos, Instagram posts things
sort. Ring lights can pretty cost-effective, yet bright
sort bright blue light going optimally stimulate melanopsin ganglion

work environment first phase, again, time wake up, try
get sunlight, even going get exercise things, want
get much bright light eyes

00:16:00 Lighting Work Phase 2

safely can want light work environment. Now
afternoon, starting nine continuing 16 hours waking,
want start dimming lights environment. Now don't want make dark
don't want get sleepy two o'clock afternoon, unless going
take brief nap, perfectly fine, long doesn't interfere

creative endeavors abstract thinking. Now, soon see,


things can improve creative thinking abstract thinking. fact,
things can improve analytic thing, will talk those, things
distinct light, right now just focusing light. recommend
doing, personally will turn off overhead lights afternoon. not
completely dim, not completely dark, will start reduce amount overhead
light just simply keep light pad whatever lamps happen
using. Now, one thing haven't talked screen brightness. highly
individual, people different retinal sensitivities. mean everybody
differs terms bright can tolerate visual environment screen.
whether not sensitive light not, will depend lot factors.
eye color, indeed people darker color eyes generally can tolerate bright
light others. green eyes, very, sensitive light. outdoors
cafe something, table kind reflective properties sunny
day, can barely see person across table me, unless wearing
sunglasses. people, members family instance, dark brown
eyes can just sit conversation without need sunglasses
all. that's, tremendous variation there, one isn't healthy
advantageous necessarily, just understand never want environment
painful maintain looking whatever looking at.
something's painful look at, damaging eyes, want
protect eyes. Now, second phase day, since us working
indoors, even working outdoors, want try get amount light
reduced overall, particular, overhead light, also want start reducing
amount blue light exposed to. somewhere around four 5:00
pm, 12 hours awake 14 hours
awake, will turn off light pad start transition lights environment
yellows reds. Now, can't always this, friends actually
converted entire homes blue light early day red light late day,
really cool fantastic, haven't done that. cost
optimal terms optimizing productivity sleep forth, not feasible
lot people. simply switch using yellow lamps. will turn off
LED later afternoon, again, around four 5:00 pm, tend wake around
6:00 so, turn off. try also try dim screen
working can still manage see everything need see,


quite bit dimmer early day.

00:19:45 Lighting Work Phase 3

phase two day, want think light.
just mention, know people working middle
night, phase three, 17 24 hours waking. realize
shift workers people pulling nighters students, oftentimes
need awake studying middle night. I, somebody
years pull anywhere five 10 all-nighters per year. still pull
nighter now, again, deadlines forth. don't recommend it,
can avoid it, great, many people just simply sake shift work
impending deadlines procrastination above. going
work third phase circadian cycle, really want limit
amount bright light getting eyes just amount allows
work doing. get light eyes, brighter
that, going severely deplete melatonin levels. going
severely shift circadian clock effectively like traveling another time zone.
stay 3:00 6:00 2:00 4:00 working term
paper something sort, getting bright light eyes,
effectively flying six hours different time zone, least body
registers as. can really throw sleep metabolism number
things whack. Now exception this, really want
awake, can often beneficial flipping lights room keeping
really bright. One hardest things stay night studying
dim environment. determine trade off whether
not want shift clock whether not want get work done.
say ideal situation sleep night work day
afternoon, awake middle night, understand
want dim lights overall. not want use LED,
not want overhead lights on, unless really struggling stay awake,
case want get many bright lights possible. couple
tricks all-nighters, don't really want people pulling all-nighters unless to,
things can without taking stimulants order stay


night, can beneficial maximize biology. One little
less commonly known can drink 32 ounces water commit not going

urinate, makes alert. many probably experienced,
actually wakes us middle night use
bathroom circuit alertness goes full bladder, signaled

bedwetting issues. number cognitive behavioral approaches
that, sometimes bedwetting young kids circuit hasn't developed
yet. adults fortunately not bedwetting, can increase amount
alertness system remain awake middle night, drinking little

certainly will lend alertness. know difficult fall asleep
use restroom instance. one tool. thing again,
flip many bright lights environment possible. course, people
will rely stimulants like caffeine even aggressive stimulants. not
something necessarily recommend, determine you.
fact, use all-nighters reason, can maximize bladder
brain approach right light approach. less covers bright
keep overall environment bright keep screen. really want
get nerdy this, free app called Light Meter can start
measuring many lux, many photons given environment. actually
measuring reflectance photons on, can look Lux Meter does,
like, don't necessarily recommend that. don't want set critical threshold
which, instance, say, environment 1,500 lux,
bright not bright enough, et cetera. Everyone different retinal sensitivities,
everyone will find different levels brightness will cause alert, different
levels dimness, will, room will cause feel sleepy. really want
just modulate across 24 hour cycle bright, bright safely can
early day alert. can focus detailed work first
phase, afternoon, move creative type works abstract
thinking, working people kind brainstorming mode



00:24:17 Look Work

shift dimmer lights, yellow lights, eliminate blue lights much
possible. Now light, another aspect vision shown
critically important alert going well can maintain
alertness. visual focus given environment.
not talking overall brightness, referring now simply

00:28:02 Arranging Environment

can exploited, indeed researched terms can used
optimize work environments. Contrary people do, look
laptop, tablet, phone, want alert want maintain
maximum amount focus whatever reading doing, want
screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus

neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling

so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked

never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage

lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off

vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside

people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off

silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way

subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles

nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved

Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40

talk phase 24 hour day moment. early part day
time day sake workspace optimization, brightly lit
environment can lend optimal work throughout day, not just early
phase. many episodes podcast, also emphasized
importance getting morning sunlight eyes within 30 60 minutes waking,
not often, now, again, will also mention important light
daytime environment brightly safely can. going work
early, call phase one portion day, want much light
indeed much overhead light shining safely possible. course
don't want bright glaring squint, et cetera, want
much light safely possible. can couple simple ways. One

doing, personally will turn off overhead lights afternoon. not
completely dim, not completely dark, will start reduce amount overhead
light just simply keep light pad whatever lamps happen
using. Now, one thing haven't talked screen brightness. highly

differs terms bright can tolerate visual environment screen.
whether not sensitive light not, will depend lot factors.
eye color, indeed people darker color eyes generally can tolerate bright
light others. green eyes, very, sensitive light. outdoors

all. that's, tremendous variation there, one isn't healthy
advantageous necessarily, just understand never want environment
painful maintain looking whatever looking at.
something's painful look at, damaging eyes, want
protect eyes. Now, second phase day, since us working
indoors, even working outdoors, want try get amount light
reduced overall, particular, overhead light, also want start reducing
amount blue light exposed to. somewhere around four 5:00
pm, 12 hours awake 14 hours
awake, will turn off light pad start transition lights environment

really cool fantastic, haven't done that. cost
optimal terms optimizing productivity sleep forth, not feasible
lot people. simply switch using yellow lamps. will turn off
LED later afternoon, again, around four 5:00 pm, tend wake around
6:00 so, turn off. try also try dim screen

phase two day, want think light.
just mention, know people working middle

shift workers people pulling nighters students, oftentimes
need awake studying middle night. I, somebody
years pull anywhere five 10 all-nighters per year. still pull

can avoid it, great, many people just simply sake shift work
impending deadlines procrastination above. going
work third phase circadian cycle, really want limit

00:24:17 Look Work

shift dimmer lights, yellow lights, eliminate blue lights much
possible. Now light, another aspect vision shown
critically important alert going well can maintain
alertness. visual focus given environment.
not talking overall brightness, referring now simply

can move eye socket side side down. also
muscles can actually pull eyeballs angles. different
muscles can move eyes different angles well, can look

neurons control muscles interesting feature,
looking toward ground anywhere below, basically central region

00:28:02 Arranging Environment

can exploited, indeed researched terms can used
optimize work environments. Contrary people do, look
laptop, tablet, phone, want alert want maintain
maximum amount focus whatever reading doing, want
screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus

neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling

so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.

deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage

work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types

expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones

tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild

outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system

certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off

subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles

again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted

read peer-reviewed research, pretty compelling, treadmilling
seems like interesting way increase alertness cognitive performance. not
sure cycling method can't imagine just cycling typing

whatever reason, just bias. know ride bicycle,
anyway, pick preference. things order
improve workplace performance consider cathedral effect.

kind, artwork, consider getting high ceiling no ceiling environment,
wearing brimmed hat wearing hoodie, maybe peel back. Again,
data within peer reviewed literature support sorts practices.
like start layering protocols, means, please that. no

00:19:45 Lighting Work Phase 3

phase two day, want think light.
just mention, know people working middle
night, phase three, 17 24 hours waking. realize
shift workers people pulling nighters students, oftentimes
need awake studying middle night. I, somebody
years pull anywhere five 10 all-nighters per year. still pull

00:24:17 Look Work

shift dimmer lights, yellow lights, eliminate blue lights much

much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use

00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage
level depth focus like right off bat. timed
studies timed rigorous way, mine just call anecdata,
timed myself, studies looked this. data
point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly
short period time. However, can extend period time, talked
episode focus, importantly, sit start work
kind, kind expect take six minutes engage
neural circuits, wouldn't expect walk gym PR lift

surprised need that. yet sort expect brain able
lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six
minutes engage work neurochemical systems will take

distraction, things like Freedom, app, free app allows
lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off
distance rush river. Whereas small spaces, everything,
vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling
higher, expansive space lot distance us space us
sides, maybe even field, thinking goes broad
abstract kind loftier future thinking particular. actually measured.
really nice paper, will post link this. authors Joan Meyers-Levy

really cool paper looked rigorous statistics
fair number subjects everything paper looks solid me.
difference cognitive processing, abstract thinking detailed analytic work
people able perform environments 10 foot ceiling versus eight
foot ceiling, not much difference, just two foot difference there.
found significant effects whereby high ceilings, activate concepts
related abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts, but,
promote kind detailed thinking lends well sort spreadsheet type
work accounting type work. Whereas abstract creative work supported
higher ceilings. way analyze really interesting. Again, don't
time go details, ask people sort generate word sets
related particular topics like sports. people will talk soccer, football,
baseball, golf, et cetera, talk equipment things.
kind challenge, cognitive challenge whereby people link
different concepts along different dimensions depart dimension
sport start thinking sports involve teams sports involve ball,
et cetera. conditions can, except fact ceiling
height different eight feet 10 feet, one finds kinds language


kinds associations people start create vastly different. there're
actually two experiments study, welcome go look it, wasn't just
sports, things analyzed well.

case, recommend want creative work phase two, nine 16

controlling height visual world, don't control ceiling
height environment in, another way that. used
observe cafes, around Stanford, Bay area
see somebody who, despite weather hoodie, maybe baseball
cap form hat sort blinder eyebrows, actually
another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual
field. Not unlike blinders talked one put horse
one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive
generate, whereas writing music writing poetry generating new material
kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need

Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously
extent can tolerate background noise work. fact, individuals will vary
tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not

about, maybe even noise, maybe even music room.

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

01:11:17 Binaural Beats Increase Focus

exact time work, although also enhance
productivity. might craving little bit mechanism
binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect
called striatal dopamine. dopamine neuromodulator course,
involved many things motivation, actually involved adaptation light
retina. Something people don't know, involved movement,
people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually
movement deficits on. striatal dopamine closely related motivation
focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set
height makes standing best practice, can lowered height
makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost
pressure effects pelvic floor things sort, depending chairs
one uses. people stand slightly better situation many
health metrics improve, people combination sitting
standing desk throughout day, move one desk another,

like placing boxes books create standing desk, high cost cases.
Now interesting, look scientific literature, people decreased
sitting time half day. took, say working
seven hours day, three half hours day, decide stand, not
even clear matters three hours one about, divide
shorter bouts half hour, sit half hour, et cetera,
alternating back forth showed incredibly significant effects reduced neck

hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work

mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high

pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get

never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.

deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage

lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six

lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,

scientific meetings lot scientific meetings person,
always individuals seem stay engaged throughout long
meetings. talking seven, eight hour day, sometimes evening sessions,
sometimes meetings go for, four five even six days. long
meetings quality talks vary tremendously, always notice individuals
manage stay engaged awake entire meeting. noticed
people maintain high levels alertness one conference room
habit moving different seat session, sometimes even talks.
actually discussed one colleagues this, said,
conscious, always moving place place? said, yeah, just stay
one place just look one particular visual angle screen, find
one two talks, regardless interesting talks are, start take draft,
mind isn't engaged indeed, sometimes can fall asleep. started
practice moving space space, say, seat seat within
auditorium works quite well. think works quite well again,
relationship visual system driving majority cognition, visual

things can improve creative thinking abstract thinking. fact,
things can improve analytic thing, will talk those, things
distinct light, right now just focusing light. recommend
doing, personally will turn off overhead lights afternoon. not
completely dim, not completely dark, will start reduce amount overhead
light just simply keep light pad whatever lamps happen
using. Now, one thing haven't talked screen brightness. highly
individual, people different retinal sensitivities. mean everybody
differs terms bright can tolerate visual environment screen.
whether not sensitive light not, will depend lot factors.
eye color, indeed people darker color eyes generally can tolerate bright
light others. green eyes, very, sensitive light. outdoors
cafe something, table kind reflective properties sunny
day, can barely see person across table me, unless wearing
sunglasses. people, members family instance, dark brown
eyes can just sit conversation without need sunglasses
all. that's, tremendous variation there, one isn't healthy
advantageous necessarily, just understand never want environment
painful maintain looking whatever looking at.
something's painful look at, damaging eyes, want
protect eyes. Now, second phase day, since us working
indoors, even working outdoors, want try get amount light
reduced overall, particular, overhead light, also want start reducing
amount blue light exposed to. somewhere around four 5:00
pm, 12 hours awake 14 hours
awake, will turn off light pad start transition lights environment
yellows reds. Now, can't always this, friends actually
converted entire homes blue light early day red light late day,
really cool fantastic, haven't done that. cost
optimal terms optimizing productivity sleep forth, not feasible
lot people. simply switch using yellow lamps. will turn off
LED later afternoon, again, around four 5:00 pm, tend wake around
6:00 so, turn off. try also try dim screen
working can still manage see everything need see,


quite bit dimmer early day.

00:19:45 Lighting Work Phase 3

phase two day, want think light.
just mention, know people working middle
night, phase three, 17 24 hours waking. realize
shift workers people pulling nighters students, oftentimes
need awake studying middle night. I, somebody
years pull anywhere five 10 all-nighters per year. still pull
nighter now, again, deadlines forth. don't recommend it,
can avoid it, great, many people just simply sake shift work
impending deadlines procrastination above. going
work third phase circadian cycle, really want limit
amount bright light getting eyes just amount allows
work doing. get light eyes, brighter
that, going severely deplete melatonin levels. going
severely shift circadian clock effectively like traveling another time zone.
stay 3:00 6:00 2:00 4:00 working term
paper something sort, getting bright light eyes,
effectively flying six hours different time zone, least body
registers as. can really throw sleep metabolism number
things whack. Now exception this, really want
awake, can often beneficial flipping lights room keeping
really bright. One hardest things stay night studying
dim environment. determine trade off whether
not want shift clock whether not want get work done.
say ideal situation sleep night work day
afternoon, awake middle night, understand
want dim lights overall. not want use LED,
not want overhead lights on, unless really struggling stay awake,
case want get many bright lights possible. couple
tricks all-nighters, don't really want people pulling all-nighters unless to,
things can without taking stimulants order stay


night, can beneficial maximize biology. One little
less commonly known can drink 32 ounces water commit not going
bathroom 90 minutes, least. turns circuit goes
bladder, literally neurons go bladder brainstem
urinate, makes alert. many probably experienced,
actually wakes us middle night use
bathroom circuit alertness goes full bladder, signaled
bladder full brainstem. circuit disrupted kids
bedwetting issues. number cognitive behavioral approaches
that, sometimes bedwetting young kids circuit hasn't developed
yet. adults fortunately not bedwetting, can increase amount
alertness system remain awake middle night, drinking little
bit water normally refraining going restroom,
certainly will lend alertness. know difficult fall asleep
use restroom instance. one tool. thing again,
flip many bright lights environment possible. course, people
will rely stimulants like caffeine even aggressive stimulants. not
something necessarily recommend, determine you.
fact, use all-nighters reason, can maximize bladder
brain approach right light approach. less covers bright
keep overall environment bright keep screen. really want
get nerdy this, free app called Light Meter can start
measuring many lux, many photons given environment. actually
measuring reflectance photons on, can look Lux Meter does,
like, don't necessarily recommend that. don't want set critical threshold
which, instance, say, environment 1,500 lux,
bright not bright enough, et cetera. Everyone different retinal sensitivities,
everyone will find different levels brightness will cause alert, different
levels dimness, will, room will cause feel sleepy. really want
just modulate across 24 hour cycle bright, bright safely can
early day alert. can focus detailed work first
phase, afternoon, move creative type works abstract
thinking, working people kind brainstorming mode



00:24:17 Look Work

shift dimmer lights, yellow lights, eliminate blue lights much
possible. Now light, another aspect vision shown
critically important alert going well can maintain
alertness. visual focus given environment.
not talking overall brightness, referring now simply
place phone tablet computer screen book, whatever
happen looking at. underappreciated yet incredible aspect
neurology relationship look level
alertness. works logical way, clusters neurons brain
stem clusters neurons control eyelid muscles control eye
movements sides. indeed, look eyeball,
looked lot eyeballs lab teach neural anatomy, time
time, see six muscles attached eyeball. Now four
located top, bottom two sides eyeball, sort
12 o'clock, six o'clock, three o'clock nine o'clock eyeball. muscles
can move eye socket side side down. also
muscles can actually pull eyeballs angles. different
muscles can move eyes different angles well, can look
side side, not just side side down. Now,
neurons control muscles interesting feature,
looking toward ground anywhere below, basically central region
face, neurons control eye movement intimately related areas
brainstem release certain types neuromodulators neurotransmitters.
activate areas brain associated calm indeed, even
sleepiness active inhibition prevention neurons increase
alertness. Now opposite also true, neurons place eyes
upward gaze sort level nose forehead. Literally
looking keeping head stationary, tilt head back look
up, neurons still active. neurons don't just control position
eyes cause move up, also trigger activation brain circuits
associated alertness. Now, fundamental feature way eyes
brain wired together relate call autonomic arousal.


bunch details there. will actually guest weeks
learned exploit neurons fact control different states
calm alertness order generate hypnotic states, place people atypical
states alert calm. save future
episode. important thing understand looking
level nose, essentially decelerating alertness. reducing
amount alertness, might subtle, happening. Whereas look
straight ahead particular, look up, increasing level
alertness. Now obvious implications. get sleepy, eyelids
tend close tend nod down, wide awake, tend wide-
eyed, don't tend blink often. tend chin kind vigilance
alertness. evolutionary, least adaptive component it.

00:28:02 Arranging Environment

can exploited, indeed researched terms can used
optimize work environments. Contrary people do, look
laptop, tablet, phone, want alert want maintain
maximum amount focus whatever reading doing, want
screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus
neurons, release mention things like norepinephrin epinephrin,
neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling
desk forth little bit. sit, become little less active
lie indeed, time start get feet
waist head tilted back, neurons fire less neurons brain
involved calming, indeed putting sleep, start increasing level firing.
really beautiful system. beautiful, fact, studies show
adjust angle body back, actually get sort dose-dependent
increase sleepiness calmness dose-dependent decrease alertness.
so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,
front you, ideally you, things combine generate maximum
alertness. can think might work various aspects
homework environment office work environment. describe this, many
probably thinking thinking, is, gosh,
complete opposite direction neurobiologically grounded advice. us
looking laptop seated, lying down, going
make us sleepy, positioning computers front us, really
aren't environment bright enough forth. can tell,
starting layer various things can do, first brightness room,
second, get screen try put posture work lends
promotes alertness indeed, want alert work. goal
take nap, get feet elevated 10 15 degrees head, maybe put
pillow underneath it, lie take nap, not talking
today, talking workspace optimization. suppose also exploit
all-nighter trick talked earlier, actually this,
undergraduate, little bit masochistic way. drink coffee water
fairly high volume. wasn't forced drinking anything like that, actually wouldn't
allow get use bathroom except timer. think longest
ever went three half hours. kind excruciating, actually don't think
necessarily healthy advice, again, can use slight, mentioned slight
consumption fluids order generate alertness. just really trying get
much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use
restroom, found hard re-engage work



00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage
level depth focus like right off bat. timed
studies timed rigorous way, mine just call anecdata,
timed myself, studies looked this. data
point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly
short period time. However, can extend period time, talked
episode focus, importantly, sit start work
kind, kind expect take six minutes engage
neural circuits, wouldn't expect walk gym PR lift
start running best sprint, just head door without warming
all. little walk jog first, warm sets, mean, expect that, not
surprised need that. yet sort expect brain able
lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six
minutes engage work neurochemical systems will take
time rev engage. things describing lighting
screen positioning posture, will also help maximize focus will limit
ramp time focus state. think find maximize
workspace, time latency, say get focus will start
shorten. will especially start shorten use tools limit distraction, will talk
distraction, things like Freedom, app, free app allows
lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off
distance rush river. Whereas small spaces, everything,
vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling
higher, expansive space lot distance us space us
sides, maybe even field, thinking goes broad
abstract kind loftier future thinking particular. actually measured.
really nice paper, will post link this. authors Joan Meyers-Levy

really cool paper looked rigorous statistics
fair number subjects everything paper looks solid me.
difference cognitive processing, abstract thinking detailed analytic work
people able perform environments 10 foot ceiling versus eight

found significant effects whereby high ceilings, activate concepts
related abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts, but,
promote kind detailed thinking lends well sort spreadsheet type
work accounting type work. Whereas abstract creative work supported
higher ceilings. way analyze really interesting. Again, don't
time go details, ask people sort generate word sets
related particular topics like sports. people will talk soccer, football,
baseball, golf, et cetera, talk equipment things.
kind challenge, cognitive challenge whereby people link
different concepts along different dimensions depart dimension

kinds associations people start create vastly different. there're
actually two experiments study, welcome go look it, wasn't just

references paper, also points examples cathedral effect,
find interesting vision scientist someone spends life
thinking indeed talking nervous system, know cognition
follows vision. low vision blind people will follow mostly hearing
extent touch. people sighted, people cited,
cognition follows visual environment. mean workspace
optimization? Well, us fixed ceiling level home, might
rooms ceiling higher rooms ceiling lower.
case, recommend want creative work phase two, nine 16
hours circadian cycle, nine 16 hours waking is,
high ceiling room, maybe even outdoors deck patio. Cause
highest ceiling courses sky. Whereas going detailed analytic work
suggest phase one day. even going
phase two day, whatever reason, scheduling sorts
constraints lower ceiling environment. Now, interested
controlling height visual world, don't control ceiling
height environment in, another way that. used
observe cafes, around Stanford, Bay area
see somebody who, despite weather hoodie, maybe baseball
cap form hat sort blinder eyebrows, actually
another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual
field. Not unlike blinders talked one put horse
one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive
generate, whereas writing music writing poetry generating new material
kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need

00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise

profound effect types cognitive processes able engage.
Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously

tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times

Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus
neurons, release mention things like norepinephrin epinephrin,
neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling
desk forth little bit. sit, become little less active
lie indeed, time start get feet
waist head tilted back, neurons fire less neurons brain
involved calming, indeed putting sleep, start increasing level firing.
really beautiful system. beautiful, fact, studies show
adjust angle body back, actually get sort dose-dependent
increase sleepiness calmness dose-dependent decrease alertness.
so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,
front you, ideally you, things combine generate maximum
alertness. can think might work various aspects
homework environment office work environment. describe this, many
probably thinking thinking, is, gosh,
complete opposite direction neurobiologically grounded advice. us
looking laptop seated, lying down, going
make us sleepy, positioning computers front us, really
aren't environment bright enough forth. can tell,
starting layer various things can do, first brightness room,
second, get screen try put posture work lends
promotes alertness indeed, want alert work. goal
take nap, get feet elevated 10 15 degrees head, maybe put
pillow underneath it, lie take nap, not talking
today, talking workspace optimization. suppose also exploit
all-nighter trick talked earlier, actually this,
undergraduate, little bit masochistic way. drink coffee water
fairly high volume. wasn't forced drinking anything like that, actually wouldn't
allow get use bathroom except timer. think longest
ever went three half hours. kind excruciating, actually don't think
necessarily healthy advice, again, can use slight, mentioned slight
consumption fluids order generate alertness. just really trying get
much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use
restroom, found hard re-engage work



00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage
level depth focus like right off bat. timed
studies timed rigorous way, mine just call anecdata,
timed myself, studies looked this. data
point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly
short period time. However, can extend period time, talked
episode focus, importantly, sit start work
kind, kind expect take six minutes engage
neural circuits, wouldn't expect walk gym PR lift
start running best sprint, just head door without warming
all. little walk jog first, warm sets, mean, expect that, not
surprised need that. yet sort expect brain able
lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six
minutes engage work neurochemical systems will take
time rev engage. things describing lighting
screen positioning posture, will also help maximize focus will limit
ramp time focus state. think find maximize
workspace, time latency, say get focus will start
shorten. will especially start shorten use tools limit distraction, will talk
distraction, things like Freedom, app, free app allows
lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off
distance rush river. Whereas small spaces, everything,
vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling
higher, expansive space lot distance us space us
sides, maybe even field, thinking goes broad
abstract kind loftier future thinking particular. actually measured.
really nice paper, will post link this. authors Joan Meyers-Levy
Rui, parentheses Juliet Zhu, going assume go Juliet.
title paper "The Influence Ceiling Height: "The Effect Priming "on
Type Processing People Use." won't go details paper,
really cool paper looked rigorous statistics
fair number subjects everything paper looks solid me.
difference cognitive processing, abstract thinking detailed analytic work
people able perform environments 10 foot ceiling versus eight
foot ceiling, not much difference, just two foot difference there.
found significant effects whereby high ceilings, activate concepts
related abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts, but,
promote kind detailed thinking lends well sort spreadsheet type
work accounting type work. Whereas abstract creative work supported
higher ceilings. way analyze really interesting. Again, don't
time go details, ask people sort generate word sets
related particular topics like sports. people will talk soccer, football,
baseball, golf, et cetera, talk equipment things.
kind challenge, cognitive challenge whereby people link
different concepts along different dimensions depart dimension
sport start thinking sports involve teams sports involve ball,
et cetera. conditions can, except fact ceiling
height different eight feet 10 feet, one finds kinds language


kinds associations people start create vastly different. there're
actually two experiments study, welcome go look it, wasn't just
sports, things analyzed well.
references paper, also points examples cathedral effect,
find interesting vision scientist someone spends life
thinking indeed talking nervous system, know cognition
follows vision. low vision blind people will follow mostly hearing
extent touch. people sighted, people cited,
cognition follows visual environment. mean workspace
optimization? Well, us fixed ceiling level home, might
rooms ceiling higher rooms ceiling lower.
case, recommend want creative work phase two, nine 16
hours circadian cycle, nine 16 hours waking is,
high ceiling room, maybe even outdoors deck patio. Cause
highest ceiling courses sky. Whereas going detailed analytic work
suggest phase one day. even going
phase two day, whatever reason, scheduling sorts
constraints lower ceiling environment. Now, interested
controlling height visual world, don't control ceiling
height environment in, another way that. used
observe cafes, around Stanford, Bay area
see somebody who, despite weather hoodie, maybe baseball
cap form hat sort blinder eyebrows, actually
another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual
field. Not unlike blinders talked one put horse
one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive
generate, whereas writing music writing poetry generating new material
kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need

00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise

profound effect types cognitive processes able engage.
Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously
extent can tolerate background noise work. fact, individuals will vary
tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not
engage focus. worked generate focus go cafe
library someplace actually commotion, people moving
about, maybe even noise, maybe even music room.
touch want background noise, want less background

talking background noise avoid actually can cause
pretty severe deficits cognition. paper first author, Jordan Love, cool name,

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going
work about. remember moment start listening binaural
beats, brain doesn't immediately switch particular pattern oscillation brain

delightful text message. comes shifting whole brain state toward
optimizing work, takes little bit time. again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many,
many apps, many YouTube scripts there, probably resources binaural
beats, hopefully zero cost, can access without need shell
money. find one particularly like, maybe put comment section,
people can find it, YouTube best place that. Feel free put

01:11:17 Binaural Beats Increase Focus

exact time work, although also enhance
productivity. might craving little bit mechanism
binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect
called striatal dopamine. dopamine neuromodulator course,
involved many things motivation, actually involved adaptation light
retina. Something people don't know, involved movement,
people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually
movement deficits on. striatal dopamine closely related motivation
focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal

binaural beats appears increase spontaneous blink rates increases
dopamine transmission brainstem striatum several locations fact.
way binaural beats set rhythm brain, recruits

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set
height makes standing best practice, can lowered height
makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost
pressure effects pelvic floor things sort, depending chairs
one uses. people stand slightly better situation many
health metrics improve, people combination sitting
standing desk throughout day, move one desk another,
don't combination sit-stand desk, going best. good news
easy convert sit desk stand desk, can just stack boxes,
done times stack books. also pedestals things
can purchase preference order set computer particular
height. course desks motors ones
cranks, sorts variations, terms types whether not
motors well cost things. can go low cost,
like placing boxes books create standing desk, high cost cases.
Now interesting, look scientific literature, people decreased
sitting time half day. took, say working
seven hours day, three half hours day, decide stand, not
even clear matters three hours one about, divide
shorter bouts half hour, sit half hour, et cetera,
alternating back forth showed incredibly significant effects reduced neck
shoulder pain, increase subjective health, vitality work-related environments.
perhaps importantly, sake today's discussion improvement cognitive

whatever reason, just bias. know ride bicycle,
anyway, pick preference. things order
improve workplace performance consider cathedral effect.

screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus
neurons, release mention things like norepinephrin epinephrin,
neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling

really beautiful system. beautiful, fact, studies show
adjust angle body back, actually get sort dose-dependent
increase sleepiness calmness dose-dependent decrease alertness.
so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

undergraduate, little bit masochistic way. drink coffee water
fairly high volume. wasn't forced drinking anything like that, actually wouldn't
allow get use bathroom except timer. think longest

necessarily healthy advice, again, can use slight, mentioned slight

much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use
restroom, found hard re-engage work



00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage

point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly

surprised need that. yet sort expect brain able
lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six

distraction, things like Freedom, app, free app allows
lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild

outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say

reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system

certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put

subsequent that. not magic, ways

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40

maximum amount focus whatever reading doing, want
screen whatever looking least eye level ideally
slightly it. Now, haven't seen many workspaces take advantage
hardwired neuro-biological fact. information? Well,
somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work
phones small visual window, can talk
issue later. idea place screen tablet laptop
computer, try get elevated least nose level, nose level,
even higher. Now realize can complicated do, long, just used stack
books, sometimes take box turn upside set there. use
mixed standing-seated desk, talk minutes. number
different ways this, wall mount monitor. think many
people working laptops, little bit harder laptop,
people though will configure second screen. decide right


budget. again, addition brightly lit room, able focus
attend whatever working on, want screen positioned high
visual environment. Now wouldn't want ceiling necessarily, know
pretty cool, want you. Now, couple
solutions don't involve wall mount stacking books boxes. instance,
one people likes lie bed sofa get
screen putting pillows knees. used actually lot
writing work middle night, don't anymore don't
recommend it, used lot work bed. Now no longer bring electronics
work bedroom. just really try keep bedroom sleeping
whatever else. terms lying couch, somewhat easier get
screen you, can kind slide underneath screen get typing,
problem that. talk little bit moment,
turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will
either directly front slightly you. wanted get really
fancy, create situation slightly tilted toward
actually maintain kind proper neck posture. accomplishes
number things. addition making alert, also get away so-
called text neck. know, people starting look like C's nowadays,
shape letter C constantly looking down. every while,
see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical
workspace.

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus

neurons become active standing. become even active


ambulatory, moving will talk treadmilling cycling

so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types

expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system

small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular

vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside

people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way

way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."

somebody sits work starts feel sleepy, simply
unfocused, unable attend whatever doing, highly recommend
take laptop tablet. hope people aren't serious work

turns posture, literally position body relative gravity, also
important implications alert are. ideally standing seated.
say ideal standing, second best will seated screen will

see somebody texting public eye level, always looks little odd
that, always admire posture time, shouldn't
give hard time. another feature can arrange physical

00:31:24 Body Posture

Again, whether not seated standing throughout day, try get
screen elevated. Now reference posture, beautiful data illustrating
standing up, neurons brainstem, locus coeruleus

neurons become active standing. become even active

so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

never ask sit stand immediately focus something,

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even

cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."

so, told sit straight even better, just stand straight, now
also telling get visual thing attending to, screen otherwise,

undergraduate, little bit masochistic way. drink coffee water
fairly high volume. wasn't forced drinking anything like that, actually wouldn't
allow get use bathroom except timer. think longest
ever went three half hours. kind excruciating, actually don't think
necessarily healthy advice, again, can use slight, mentioned slight
consumption fluids order generate alertness. just really trying get
much work done could, very, demanding class schedule
just way get work done. getting every minutes, use
restroom, found hard re-engage work



00:34:22 Long Deep Work

maintain focus, just want briefly mention now. talked
episode focus, one thing completely unreasonable
never ask sit stand immediately focus something,
unless stressed looking at, very, excited it.
stressed sort information deadline, very,
excited something, find can focus instantly just within moment.
deployment neurochemicals like dopamine
norepinephrine bring levels alertness. However, us, including
myself, will go begin work find mind doesn't quite engage
level depth focus like right off bat. timed
studies timed rigorous way, mine just call anecdata,
timed myself, studies looked this. data
point fact even heightened levels focus, people can
maintain focus switching tasks three minutes, depressingly
short period time. However, can extend period time, talked
episode focus, importantly, sit start work
kind, kind expect take six minutes engage
neural circuits, wouldn't expect walk gym PR lift
start running best sprint, just head door without warming
all. little walk jog first, warm sets, mean, expect that, not
surprised need that. yet sort expect brain able
lock work focused way immediately. just ridiculous
assumption, unfair assumption, say. assume will take six
minutes engage work neurochemical systems will take
time rev engage. things describing lighting
screen positioning posture, will also help maximize focus will limit
ramp time focus state. think find maximize
workspace, time latency, say get focus will start
shorten. will especially start shorten use tools limit distraction, will talk
distraction, things like Freedom, app, free app allows
lock internet turning off phone instance. even


work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off
distance rush river. Whereas small spaces, everything,
vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling
higher, expansive space lot distance us space us
sides, maybe even field, thinking goes broad
abstract kind loftier future thinking particular. actually measured.
really nice paper, will post link this. authors Joan Meyers-Levy
Rui, parentheses Juliet Zhu, going assume go Juliet.
title paper "The Influence Ceiling Height: "The Effect Priming "on

really cool paper looked rigorous statistics
fair number subjects everything paper looks solid me.
difference cognitive processing, abstract thinking detailed analytic work
people able perform environments 10 foot ceiling versus eight
foot ceiling, not much difference, just two foot difference there.
found significant effects whereby high ceilings, activate concepts
related abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts, but,
promote kind detailed thinking lends well sort spreadsheet type
work accounting type work. Whereas abstract creative work supported
higher ceilings. way analyze really interesting. Again, don't
time go details, ask people sort generate word sets
related particular topics like sports. people will talk soccer, football,
baseball, golf, et cetera, talk equipment things.
kind challenge, cognitive challenge whereby people link
different concepts along different dimensions depart dimension
sport start thinking sports involve teams sports involve ball,
et cetera. conditions can, except fact ceiling
height different eight feet 10 feet, one finds kinds language


kinds associations people start create vastly different. there're
actually two experiments study, welcome go look it, wasn't just
sports, things analyzed well.
references paper, also points examples cathedral effect,
find interesting vision scientist someone spends life
thinking indeed talking nervous system, know cognition
follows vision. low vision blind people will follow mostly hearing
extent touch. people sighted, people cited,
cognition follows visual environment. mean workspace
optimization? Well, us fixed ceiling level home, might
rooms ceiling higher rooms ceiling lower.
case, recommend want creative work phase two, nine 16
hours circadian cycle, nine 16 hours waking is,
high ceiling room, maybe even outdoors deck patio. Cause
highest ceiling courses sky. Whereas going detailed analytic work

controlling height visual world, don't control ceiling
height environment in, another way that. used
observe cafes, around Stanford, Bay area
see somebody who, despite weather hoodie, maybe baseball
cap form hat sort blinder eyebrows, actually
another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual
field. Not unlike blinders talked one put horse
one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive
generate, whereas writing music writing poetry generating new material
kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need

00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise

profound effect types cognitive processes able engage.
Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously
extent can tolerate background noise work. fact, individuals will vary
tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not
engage focus. worked generate focus go cafe
library someplace actually commotion, people moving
about, maybe even noise, maybe even music room.
touch want background noise, want less background
noise, no hard fast rule. look across literature studies
involve complete silence white noise binaural beats, music classical music
rock roll, can find results support type environment

talking background noise avoid actually can cause
pretty severe deficits cognition. paper first author, Jordan Love, cool name,

brown noise working? Certainly lot people do. fact, want
know white noise, pink noise brown noise are, just different
constellations auditory frequencies played together. us think white

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

delightful text message. comes shifting whole brain state toward
optimizing work, takes little bit time. again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many,
many apps, many YouTube scripts there, probably resources binaural
beats, hopefully zero cost, can access without need shell
money. find one particularly like, maybe put comment section,
people can find it, YouTube best place that. Feel free put

01:11:17 Binaural Beats Increase Focus

exact time work, although also enhance
productivity. might craving little bit mechanism
binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect
called striatal dopamine. dopamine neuromodulator course,
involved many things motivation, actually involved adaptation light
retina. Something people don't know, involved movement,
people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually
movement deficits on. striatal dopamine closely related motivation
focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set
height makes standing best practice, can lowered height
makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost
pressure effects pelvic floor things sort, depending chairs
one uses. people stand slightly better situation many
health metrics improve, people combination sitting
standing desk throughout day, move one desk another,
don't combination sit-stand desk, going best. good news
easy convert sit desk stand desk, can just stack boxes,
done times stack books. also pedestals things
can purchase preference order set computer particular
height. course desks motors ones
cranks, sorts variations, terms types whether not
motors well cost things. can go low cost,
like placing boxes books create standing desk, high cost cases.
Now interesting, look scientific literature, people decreased
sitting time half day. took, say working
seven hours day, three half hours day, decide stand, not
even clear matters three hours one about, divide
shorter bouts half hour, sit half hour, et cetera,
alternating back forth showed incredibly significant effects reduced neck
shoulder pain, increase subjective health, vitality work-related environments.
perhaps importantly, sake today's discussion improvement cognitive
conditioning ability embrace new tasks cognitive performance.
several studies one wanted explore, explore detail.
put link well. article referring called "Effects Workplace
"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention Health Productivity." like paper
many papers focus effects sit-stand desks health trying
get people burn calories, improve posture, relieve neck pain, slumped over,

work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system

go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off

vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside

people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling

another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual

one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive

kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need

Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room

lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously

tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not

Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put

work phone involves

00:36:50 Set Right Visual Window Size

phone internet, many us including do, expect ramp
time focus. another aspect vision absolutely critical
optimizing workspace. really interesting feature
visual pathways two major channels. two major channels
names, although don't remember names. first one so-called
parvocellular channel, involved looking things specific points space
high resolution detail. so-called magnocellular channel,
involved looking big swaths visual space lower resolution.
can think parvocellular system kind high pixel density, think
modern smartphone, recent smartphone best, best camera. think
magnocellular system lower resolution, kind older smartphone,
lower pixels, et cetera. might ask, want system low
resolution. Well, low resolution system better things like detecting motion
not much detail vice versa. Now, again, don't remember
names, remember, however, going create
maximum amount alertness system. maximum amount ability focus
system parvocellular mode, bringing eyes
common point, call vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E. said
podcast, people said, virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye
movement. convergence, bringing eyes single point space, will create
narrower aperture visual window, meaning visual world actually shrinks
least perceptually. Whereas relax eyes dilate gaze, can
now whatever environment in, trying see without moving head off
side, above, you, broadly possible, maybe can dilate gaze
much can see yourself, body visual environment. notice
resolution vision isn't nearly high vergence eye
movement. Vergence eye movements incredibly powerful creating heightened
states alertness focus. indeed create heightened states cognition,
thinking, brain follows vision terms focus.
say can't focus, often experiencing ability, inability, excuse me,


not focus visually. Whereas focused state, state
often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes
focused mode,

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off
distance rush river. Whereas small spaces, everything,
vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling
higher, expansive space lot distance us space us
sides, maybe even field, thinking goes broad
abstract kind loftier future thinking particular. actually measured.
really nice paper, will post link this. authors Joan Meyers-Levy
Rui, parentheses Juliet Zhu, going assume go Juliet.
title paper "The Influence Ceiling Height: "The Effect Priming "on
Type Processing People Use." won't go details paper,
really cool paper looked rigorous statistics
fair number subjects everything paper looks solid me.
difference cognitive processing, abstract thinking detailed analytic work
people able perform environments 10 foot ceiling versus eight
foot ceiling, not much difference, just two foot difference there.
found significant effects whereby high ceilings, activate concepts
related abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts, but,
promote kind detailed thinking lends well sort spreadsheet type
work accounting type work. Whereas abstract creative work supported
higher ceilings. way analyze really interesting. Again, don't
time go details, ask people sort generate word sets
related particular topics like sports. people will talk soccer, football,
baseball, golf, et cetera, talk equipment things.
kind challenge, cognitive challenge whereby people link
different concepts along different dimensions depart dimension
sport start thinking sports involve teams sports involve ball,
et cetera. conditions can, except fact ceiling
height different eight feet 10 feet, one finds kinds language


kinds associations people start create vastly different. there're
actually two experiments study, welcome go look it, wasn't just
sports, things analyzed well.
references paper, also points examples cathedral effect,
find interesting vision scientist someone spends life
thinking indeed talking nervous system, know cognition
follows vision. low vision blind people will follow mostly hearing
extent touch. people sighted, people cited,
cognition follows visual environment. mean workspace
optimization? Well, us fixed ceiling level home, might
rooms ceiling higher rooms ceiling lower.
case, recommend want creative work phase two, nine 16
hours circadian cycle, nine 16 hours waking is,
high ceiling room, maybe even outdoors deck patio. Cause
highest ceiling courses sky. Whereas going detailed analytic work
suggest phase one day. even going
phase two day, whatever reason, scheduling sorts
constraints lower ceiling environment. Now, interested
controlling height visual world, don't control ceiling
height environment in, another way that. used
observe cafes, around Stanford, Bay area
see somebody who, despite weather hoodie, maybe baseball
cap form hat sort blinder eyebrows, actually
another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual
field. Not unlike blinders talked one put horse
one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging
novel ways. can think like notes piano, playing particular song,
learning scales, analytic. correct answer trying arrive
generate, whereas writing music writing poetry generating new material
kind, involves taking existing elements, right? not going use words
don't committed memory not aware of, arranging
novel ways. think cathedral effect can leveraged. again, don't need
move different home build slanted roof work one side room

want swing it, great, us don't flexibility, clear
height ceiling visual environment in,

00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise

profound effect types cognitive processes able engage.
Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously
extent can tolerate background noise work. fact, individuals will vary
tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not
engage focus. worked generate focus go cafe
library someplace actually commotion, people moving
about, maybe even noise, maybe even music room.
touch want background noise, want less background
noise, no hard fast rule. look across literature studies
involve complete silence white noise binaural beats, music classical music
rock roll, can find results support type environment
beneficial. However, talk moment, types
environments really avoid types sounds really can enhance


cognition ability focus workspace environment across board,
really seemed work people. talk background noise avoid.
talking background noise avoid actually can cause
pretty severe deficits cognition. paper first author, Jordan Love, cool name,
last author Alexander Francis. The, title paper
"Psychophysiological responses potentially annoying "heating, ventilation air
conditioning noise "during mentally demanding work," mouthful. basically
paper identifies large dataset workplace environmental noise,
mostly humming air conditioners loud humming heaters,
loud ongoing, just incessant doesn't let up, can really increase mental fatigue
can vastly decrease cognitive performance. interested looking
cognitive performance data authors Banbury & Berry 2005, paper one
supports fact cognitive performance worse just hum
air conditioner background hum heater otherwise complete
silence. also evidence discussed episode hearing,
young children, white noise can cause impairments development
auditory system. Now don't want parents freak exposed white
noise, sleep aid child, know many were, don't freak out,
turns white noise, especially loud, white noise can cause disruption
auditory maps, representation different frequencies sound brain
can lead deficits auditory even language processing. really
careful long-term exposure, extended exposure white noise, kind
air conditioning noise really high level. wouldn't worry
background shutting off turning again, thermostat kicks off on,
really try avoid work loud fan filled ventilation generating heat generating
environments, really can cause damage auditory system long-term
described, can impair cognitive performance overall increase fatigue. think
experienced room ongoing background
noise sudden stops just feel enormous relief [sighs].
reason auditory system parallel visual system.
visual system, light entering eyes triggers activation melanopsin
cells, triggers activation hypothalamus, particular area
hypothalamus, generates alertness, generates release, even cortisol,
stress hormone. auditory system, ongoing sound, auditory


system hears that, even not paying attention it, paying attention
something else, still registers. little hair cells, called inner ear
fluttering, eardrum beating concert sound frequency.
brainstem mechanism generates alertness kind vigilant.
sound ongoing background, shuts off, sudden
experienced peace, turning off brainstem circuits
associated vigilance, locus coeruleus, talked earlier,
release epinephrin norepinephrine generate heightened state alertness
brain body, neurons can turn off experience
relaxation. mean shouldn't listen white noise pink noise
brown noise working? Certainly lot people do. fact, want
know white noise, pink noise brown noise are, just different
constellations auditory frequencies played together. us think white
noise [shushing] screen, black white pixels going around, like
call visual snow, pink noise certain sound frequencies, notched out, taken
out, brown noise others. different frequencies included higher
amplitude, et cetera. can look stuff YouTube, want, just put
brown noise. None sounds terrific, doesn't sound like music. literally just noise,
mixed frequencies no particular arrangement. evidence playing
white noise background headphones pink noise brown noise can
facilitate cognition, mainly increase overall alertness
consequence areas like locus coeruleus brainstem areas
associated autonomic arousal noise. lot like air conditioner
effect. think done restricted way, meaning not hours hours, maybe
focus waning hard time engaging work, might put
brown noise white noise pink noise work way 45 minutes
go panoramic vision walk get sunlight, fine.
really no reason suspect, however,

01:02:20 Binaural Beats Work

particular patterns noise going optimize particular mental functions.
like turn next particular patterns sounds indeed
shown peer-reviewed studies optimize certain types mental processing,


can incorporate optimized workspace environment,
headphones speakers, whatever mechanism want, order get
work efforts. search apps go online try find
sounds can improve thinking change emotions. generally going
find three types. One called isochronic tones, tones usually common
frequency. might beep pause, beep
frequency, beep, forgive terrible beeping. don't know good beeping
sound like, contrast isochronic tones monaural beats. Monaural beats
repetitive, almost percussive like beats delivered just one ear, [vocalizing],
kind thing. can find apps can deliver monaural beats, can find also
apps deliver so-called binaural beats. can also find YouTube scripts
channels will deliver binaural beats. Binaural beats name suggests, beats
delivered two ears, one pattern kind percussive beat one ear
different pattern, least pattern phase, not synchronized,
delivered ear. one ear hear, [vocalizing] ear,
got [vocalizing]. happens way auditory
system converges brainstem generates called interaural time
differences, explain means moment, interaural time differences,
difference two patterns beats heard two different
ears, leads third pattern brain entrains to, kind maps onto
generates particular types brainwaves. without going lot detail, interaural
time differences ways hear something off right,
like just snapped finger just right right ear, signal arrives
right ear sound signal, sound waves arrive left ear.
interaural ears, time difference. brainstem area
signals one ear signals ear converge, literally math
done nervous system says signal arrived signal.
difference signals interaural time difference.
snap fingers sides left right side exact time,
arrive time, interaural time difference zero. Whereas one
goes first right left, terrible snapping left, weak
snap, there, delay interaural time difference
particular value. Okay, get it, almost ridiculously simple. Binaural beats
generated ways create particular pattern interaural time differences


cascades rest brain puts forebrain areas
brain involved cognition action particular rhythm.
rhythms waves brain activity ones may heard of, things like alpha
waves theta waves gamma waves. Now don't like get attached particular
brain waves excellent particular kinds thinking. something really
popular 90s 2000s, ways measuring brain activity, noninvasively
electrodes outside, enabled people identify indeed alpha brain waves
associated alertness states. brainwaves kind larger
amplitudes, slow waves like delta waves associated kind sleepiness
relaxation, general, way brain works different brain waves
generated different structures different times. combine give us sense
happiness give us sense focus give us sense creativity. Nonetheless,
look across board studies binaural beats ask sorts
binaural beats appear useful people enhance

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going
work about. remember moment start listening binaural
beats, brain doesn't immediately switch particular pattern oscillation brain
waves, takes time. Neural circuits, again, take time engage. neural
circuits going engage instantly going ones sort
reflexive sort, like step sharp object retract limb,
suddenly stressed distressing text message, suddenly delighted


delightful text message. comes shifting whole brain state toward
optimizing work, takes little bit time. again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many,
many apps, many YouTube scripts there, probably resources binaural
beats, hopefully zero cost, can access without need shell
money. find one particularly like, maybe put comment section,
people can find it, YouTube best place that. Feel free put
link just description, will wonderful. again, don't need listen
binaural beats

01:11:17 Binaural Beats Increase Focus

exact time work, although also enhance
productivity. might craving little bit mechanism
binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect
called striatal dopamine. dopamine neuromodulator course,
involved many things motivation, actually involved adaptation light
retina. Something people don't know, involved movement,
people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually
movement deficits on. striatal dopamine closely related motivation
focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal
dopamine neurons occurring, frequently blink. associated
resetting visual window, happens blink
whole relationship blinking time perception covered episode
time perception. bottom line sake discussion. 40 Hertz


binaural beats appears increase spontaneous blink rates increases
dopamine transmission brainstem striatum several locations fact.
way binaural beats set rhythm brain, recruits
dopamine release. dopamine release leads heightened levels motivation
focus, motivation focus? Well, dopamine actually substrate
epinephrin made. Dopamine, molecule actually converted epinephrin
adrenaline work together like close cousins, dopamine epinephrin order
put us path movement work, mental movement toward
goal. little bit mechanistic meat explain least part reason
40 Hertz binaural beats

01:13:56 Minimizing Interruptions

can enhance focus, reduce reaction times improve indeed learning
memory. Next like talk role movement optimizing workspace
whether not standing, sitting, lying down, treadmilling even believe not, cycling,
can enhance work output performance. that, want touch
two aspects optimizing workspace will come point work
school life. Alas, isn't lot science around this, think worth
mentioning. think can offer little bit advice terms navigate
way beneficial you. first one interruptions. go online
ask avoid interruptions, people will say, okay, well,
kids home even don't work, light, like recording light
recording we're, busy now, sign door says bother
case emergency find knock don't knock all. used different policy
throughout years. somebody works pretty hard control time
focus, course, laboratory director, people coming want
talk things. course phones computers people's
opportunity reach us. Interruptions really deadly ability generate focus.
not just distraction occurs say minute two minutes five
minutes interrupted, also additional time get brain
circuits re-engage mode focus. really kind double whammy. Now,
none us, including want harsh cruel shut off world
oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights people providing support


useful things essential workday presumably workday
school day well. simple method learned graduate advisor
works very, well. Again, no peer review data support it, just
experience, somebody immense powers focus, very,
demanding life, long commute children, extensive laboratory, et cetera.
came asked question, anyone came asked
question, acknowledge presence, not shift body toward
them. purposely not position computer facing door, think
deadly say, deadly focus way positioning workspace.
computer facing wall, door perpendicular that. come
say, question. say yes, acknowledge
presence, wouldn't actually orient body toward me, told
conversation not going last long. no matter long stood
asked, never orient toward me, generally kept

mentioned kind extremes, think us exist extreme.


mentioned it, us like social engagement
welcome, least set work environment way welcomes interruption
very, careful this. Now digital realm, already mentioned
things can practical tools limit interruptions. One use
program Freedom, simply turn off wifi. need
online navigating, research kind, not going possible.
Turning off one's phone, times, put phone airplane mode, didn't work,
locked safe, done that, left car outside. depends one's

kind wax wane. Sometimes better avoiding distractions
others. find place hard reduce distractions,
may need go elaborate lanes. will say graduate student
lab immensely productive focused, habit coming day,
take phone, don't know turned on, off not,
just place door, excuse me, drawer go start

physically separated me. large swaths, might every hour
phone airplane mode

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set
height makes standing best practice, can lowered height
makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost
pressure effects pelvic floor things sort, depending chairs
one uses. people stand slightly better situation many
health metrics improve, people combination sitting
standing desk throughout day, move one desk another,
don't combination sit-stand desk, going best. good news
easy convert sit desk stand desk, can just stack boxes,
done times stack books. also pedestals things
can purchase preference order set computer particular
height. course desks motors ones
cranks, sorts variations, terms types whether not
motors well cost things. can go low cost,
like placing boxes books create standing desk, high cost cases.
Now interesting, look scientific literature, people decreased
sitting time half day. took, say working
seven hours day, three half hours day, decide stand, not
even clear matters three hours one about, divide
shorter bouts half hour, sit half hour, et cetera,
alternating back forth showed incredibly significant effects reduced neck
shoulder pain, increase subjective health, vitality work-related environments.
perhaps importantly, sake today's discussion improvement cognitive
conditioning ability embrace new tasks cognitive performance.
several studies one wanted explore, explore detail.
put link well. article referring called "Effects Workplace
"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention Health Productivity." like paper
many papers focus effects sit-stand desks health trying
get people burn calories, improve posture, relieve neck pain, slumped over,
et cetera, not productivity. particular paper focuses also metrics
productivity, study also references number important studies.
mean me? Well, long used standing desk
variation thereof. means probably spend half
work time standing half sitting, not sitting not standing.


one other, standing going better sitting. happens
just stand? Well, can also generate postural issues terms stabilization

can improve productivity, probably postural effects talked
earlier, lie down, tends less alertness brainstem,
will less activation brainstem circuits involved alertness.
indeed circuits involve kind calming effect body, get activated.
become upright, standing sitting, especially standing, brainstem

wearing brimmed hat wearing hoodie, maybe peel back. Again,
data within peer reviewed literature support sorts practices.
like start layering protocols, means, please that. no

often can focus visually. Now can also auditory system
touch et cetera, right now just talking visual system. Now, terms
workspace optimization, means never really want looking
square rectangle target area work far beyond ears. far
far? Really, want try keep blinders on, say invisible
blinders whatever looking falls within region visual space front
you, present cup hands put right next
eyes. Now rough estimation, now,
watching YouTube, now, trying simulate like horse blinders
on, listening, just imagine looking silly hands
cupped near eyes. to, instance, look screen very, big
close it, even standing back it, going hard
us attend everything within screen space. actually support
idea using phone tablet laptop. laptop 15 inches diameter,
think one have, 13, 17. like use big
monitors, make sure whatever looking at, want remain
focused, doesn't extend far beyond eyes are, size head
is, just think blinders horse. actually reason put blinders
horse not looking off periphery. Horses, unlike humans don't
shaped pupil, don't visual system organized quite
way, mostly see Panorama, magnocellular vision. blinders
designed keep visual focus straight ahead, physically restrict it. Now,
people will actually go lengths restrict visual focus. will
things like putting hoodie wearing hat instance, restrict visual
window. indeed works quite well, talk moment
really restrict visual window, very, narrow portion visual space,
actually changes types information best processing.
talk terms something called cathedral effect moments,
now principle, make sure whatever looking directly
front doesn't extend far side. get say six 12
certainly 18 inches side eyes, dilating gaze definition,
dilating gaze, completely subconscious, becomes hard
maintain attention. Now, caveat going look narrow


space, narrow window period time, whether not book laptop
tablet phone, vergence eye movements not create alertness,
also require energy. also can fatigue eyes process called
accommodation whereby shape eye literally change lens
can move can focus location. Accommodation's incredible process,
demanding one, reason

00:42:15 45 min / 5 min Rule

eyes get tired focus something long. principle
extracted ophthalmology neuroscience literature can adopt.
every 45 minutes focusing something like phone tablet
book page computer, want get magnocellular panoramic vision
least five minutes. way suggest actually take walk, ideally
outside. going talk ambulation, movement can
maintain alertness throughout day. every 45 minutes so, try get five
minutes relaxing eyes. something not often done, especially
today's homeschooling kids going school Zoom adults
working Zoom, serious problem. People getting eye fatigue,
getting headaches. Indeed, people getting migraines, sorts
issues, neck pain. Much that, not that, cases can alleviated
45 five rule. every 45 minutes focused work do, get five minutes
get outside, indoors can dilate gaze. Now
may saying, well, spits face 90 minute rule. told us
focus 90 minutes. still want take breaks within
90 minutes, looking narrow piece visual world, meaning phone
laptop forth, again, best way go outside, just
relax eyes, look off distance. Looking horizon will automatically trigger
panoramic gaze, relaxing eyes will allow go back
focused work about. one thing absolutely not want go outside
check phone, outside checking phone taking
break checking phone, still vergence eye movement.
very, important vergence eye movements increase focus attention,
can exploit increase focus attention want to,


absolutely need relax system, every 45 minutes

00:44:23 Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work

want get least five minutes panoramic vision. can take 15 minute
walk, even better. Next, like talk aspect workspace optimization
can actually bias whether not brain nervous system better suited
detailed analytic work abstract work. fact, way can arrange
work environment, say way can place
certain environments will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking, indeed
expansive thinking emerge. environments can put
will make brain shift towards analytic work, toward detailed
precise types work. Now, just briefly want mention something covered
Habits episode weeks ago, again, don't need see
episode order digest information. goes back issue three phases
within circadian 24 hour cycle. Phase one, mentioned zero
eight hours waking, phase two, nine 16 hours waking, phase three 17
24 hours waking. Phase one, ideal analytic precise, detailed types
work, phase two, better suited people creative, kind abstract thinking,
expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera. exceptions that,
people follow pattern different neuromodulators hormones
forth released brain body different phases.
tell way can use physical environment shift
brain nervous system mode either prime analytic abstract
creative thinking. describe called cathedral effect.
cathedral effect discussed well really, many, many decades, maybe even
hundreds years, formally discussed since early 2000s
seemed people high ceilinged environments, hence phrase
cathedral, shift thinking ideas abstract creative lofty
type thinking. literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking, higher aspirations
observed terms language use, also sorts ideas
generate. conversely, people lower ceilinged environments
oriented toward using language restricted, literally


detailed, analytic things immediate space. Now seems kind wild
one hand, actually go back understanding neurobiology
visual system way brain body evolved different environments,
actually makes lot sense. don't time go long lecture
evolutionary neurobiology, remember nervous system
number features adapted different environments. indeed, able
go big open prairies mountaintops large cathedrals concert halls
small environments everything scales it. outdoors big,
expensive space, vision tends go long, tend panoramic, magnocellular
vision. hearing tends extend long, even conversation
somebody, tend also attending somewhat screech hawks off

vision, hearing, indeed even physical movements become
restrained. Even can still extend hands far want. mean
that? say elevator, small space compared outside
field. measured again. size amplitude
people's spontaneous movements actually scales smaller environments, even
aren't completely restricted extending limbs way, whereas
outdoors, feel natural impulse move away body,
torso limbs, just feels like appropriate behavior. say
appropriate, don't mean kind social context necessarily. actually
reason this, visual system so-called vestibular motor system
intimately linked. can just tell briefly one way can test
observe even use this, little off topic today's episode, say
certain amount flexibility. can extend arms off like wings
listening, not watching off side arms straight,
reach maximum positioning flexibility. can quick experiment
sit still, bring arms moment. can put
knees, like, front you, can move eyes far off
periphery visual field. actually, going now. looks kind
silly, moving eyes without moving head off periphery, way
right, way left, way way down, especially
way left, almost looking shoulder without turning head way
right. will find actually can extend arms back


subsequent that. not magic, ways
cerebellum, actually means mini brain eyes, visual system
connected, way cerebellum controls spindles
aspects neuromuscular architecture nervous system, 'cause
nerves control muscles allow muscles move out.
lack flexibility, can actually explore visual system this. Now
again, bit tangent, fun one relates back so-called cathedral
effect. cathedral effect way thinking becomes restricted
restrained tighter, smaller, confined visual environments. ceiling

another way just lowering ceiling height very, low restricting visual

one put restricting visual angle focus directly front
them, not far beyond sides head. cathedral effects,
think can leveraged toward particular types work best. again, lower
ceiling lower visual environment, one tends
say performs detailed analytic work accurately. one's thinking
oriented towards detailed sort correct answer type work. Whereas ceiling
higher no ceiling, brain rest processing
call cognitive processing, related abstract reasoning, brainstorming, indeed
can pull broader swaths memory resources, really abstract


reasoning is, taking existing elements maneuvering them, arranging

Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room

particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously

tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times

binaural beats appear useful people enhance

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

reflexive sort, like step sharp object retract limb,
suddenly stressed distressing text message, suddenly delighted


delightful text message. comes shifting whole brain state toward
optimizing work, takes little bit time. again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many,
many apps, many YouTube scripts there, probably resources binaural
beats, hopefully zero cost, can access without need shell
money. find one particularly like, maybe put comment section,
people can find it, YouTube best place that. Feel free put

00:55:50 Leveraging Background Noise

profound effect types cognitive processes able engage.
Now, like shift attention auditory environment noise room
music room music noise headphones, turns
lot quality scientific data speaks whether not listening
particular sounds can enhance cognition. indeed answer yes,
particular types things listen particular types conditions
allow one that. First off, want say people vary tremendously
extent can tolerate background noise work. fact, individuals will vary
tremendously one day next, even within day extent
can tolerate background noise. experienced myself, times
working home felt like whatever reason, just not
engage focus. worked generate focus go cafe

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal

10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal

idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.

10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find

significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory

10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state

well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds

significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory

memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40

10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even

well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening

et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

look across board studies binaural beats ask sorts
binaural beats appear useful people enhance

01:06:38 Best Binaural Frequency Work

brain function particular kinds tasks, arrive interesting
answers. review now. frequency binaural beats
appears bring improved cognitive functioning level memory, improved
reaction times improved verbal recall, seems 40 Hertz. Now, exactly 40
Hertz? don't know, one wants look great reference this,
reference Colzato, C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes here, quoting,
direct quote. "The present findings line "with recent study, also
found "faster reaction times participants "that listen binaural beats 40 Hertz."
can find many examples literature binaural beats 40
Hertz exactly 40 Hertz, cases, somehow brought brain state
made optimal learning, memory certain types recall, including verbal
recall, math learning, et cetera. interested binaural beats,
number free apps there. not going recommend particular,
just search one happen like. One thing will find
many apps super-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops ocean sounds
rather superimpose ocean sounds raindrops onto binaural beats,
not appear effective pure binaural beats.


exploration lower frequency binaural beats. instance, seven Hertz,
theta binaural beats done 30 minutes overlay rain sound rain sounds
analyzed believe not, showed immediate recall memory
significantly decreased. negative effect binaural beats memory.
idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory
remembering phone number. say instance, 4932931,
remember number, keeping online call working memory. likely
forget two three days later. can get improvements working
memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend
work bouts. think good reason believe can
attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going
work about. remember moment start listening binaural
beats, brain doesn't immediately switch particular pattern oscillation brain
waves, takes time. Neural circuits, again, take time engage. neural
circuits going engage instantly going ones sort
reflexive sort, like step sharp object retract limb,
suddenly stressed distressing text message, suddenly delighted


delightful text message. comes shifting whole brain state toward
optimizing work, takes little bit time. again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many,
many apps, many YouTube scripts there, probably resources binaural
beats, hopefully zero cost, can access without need shell
money. find one particularly like, maybe put comment section,
people can find it, YouTube best place that. Feel free put

01:11:17 Binaural Beats Increase Focus

exact time work, although also enhance
productivity. might craving little bit mechanism
binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect
called striatal dopamine. dopamine neuromodulator course,
involved many things motivation, actually involved adaptation light
retina. Something people don't know, involved movement,
people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually
movement deficits on. striatal dopamine closely related motivation
focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal
dopamine neurons occurring, frequently blink. associated
resetting visual window, happens blink
whole relationship blinking time perception covered episode

binaural beats appears increase spontaneous blink rates increases
dopamine transmission brainstem striatum several locations fact.
way binaural beats set rhythm brain, recruits
dopamine release. dopamine release leads heightened levels motivation
focus, motivation focus? Well, dopamine actually substrate
epinephrin made. Dopamine, molecule actually converted epinephrin
adrenaline work together like close cousins, dopamine epinephrin order
put us path movement work, mental movement toward
goal. little bit mechanistic meat explain least part reason

01:13:56 Minimizing Interruptions

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set

makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost

idea binaural beats just great us across board, think wrong.
appear higher frequency binaural beats one moves toward 40 Hertz
going beneficial. instances instance, 15 Hertz
binaural beats increased response accuracy spatial verbal memory task.
complicated working memory task. Working memory kind memory

memory 15 Hertz binaural beats, whereas control conditions, five Hertz
10 Hertz binaural beats, decreased accuracy working memory. However,
looked literature examined number different studies, always
seem come back 40 Hertz plus minus five Hertz seemed
optimal generating improvements cognition, math performance, even
various types memory recall, even musical performance. might wonder,
well, can people musical performance, listening binaural beats.
another surprise, many studies looked didn't people listening
binaural beats tasks, memory task, music learning,
et cetera, beforehand 30 minutes. instances
people listening binaural beats task. decide employ
binaural beats, recommend 40 Hertz great place start. don't recommend

attenuate it. going try it, might try ways. might try
listening binaural beats 30 minutes something else
maybe eating lunch something sort, taking walk going

binaural beats can influence things like focus reduced reaction time.
actually explored, 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems effect

people Parkinson's depletion dopamine neurons actually

focus. 40 Hertz binaural beats appears increase striatal dopamine release.
actually measured indirectly call spontaneous blink rate. Now
accused various Instagram posts, even podcast non-
blinker, call it, minimal blinker. important aside, no evidence
whatsoever people don't blink much sociopaths lie. Also, will
hear people blink lot sociopaths lying. absolutely no
evidence blink frequency correlates anything except alertness. Now longer
blinks associated less alertness. get tired, tend blink longer
longer take long blink sleep. guess long blink death,
longish blink sleep. turns firing striatal

resetting visual window, happens blink
whole relationship blinking time perception covered episode

binaural beats appears increase spontaneous blink rates increases
dopamine transmission brainstem striatum several locations fact.
way binaural beats set rhythm brain, recruits
dopamine release. dopamine release leads heightened levels motivation
focus, motivation focus? Well, dopamine actually substrate
epinephrin made. Dopamine, molecule actually converted epinephrin
adrenaline work together like close cousins, dopamine epinephrin order
put us path movement work, mental movement toward

40 Hertz binaural beats

01:13:56 Minimizing Interruptions

can enhance focus, reduce reaction times improve indeed learning
memory. Next like talk role movement optimizing workspace
whether not standing, sitting, lying down, treadmilling even believe not, cycling,
can enhance work output performance. that, want touch
two aspects optimizing workspace will come point work
school life. Alas, isn't lot science around this, think worth
mentioning. think can offer little bit advice terms navigate
way beneficial you. first one interruptions. go online
ask avoid interruptions, people will say, okay, well,
kids home even don't work, light, like recording light
recording we're, busy now, sign door says bother
case emergency find knock don't knock all. used different policy
throughout years. somebody works pretty hard control time
focus, course, laboratory director, people coming want
talk things. course phones computers people's
opportunity reach us. Interruptions really deadly ability generate focus.
not just distraction occurs say minute two minutes five
minutes interrupted, also additional time get brain
circuits re-engage mode focus. really kind double whammy. Now,
none us, including want harsh cruel shut off world
oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insights people providing support


useful things essential workday presumably workday
school day well. simple method learned graduate advisor
works very, well. Again, no peer review data support it, just
experience, somebody immense powers focus, very,
demanding life, long commute children, extensive laboratory, et cetera.
came asked question, anyone came asked
question, acknowledge presence, not shift body toward
them. purposely not position computer facing door, think
deadly say, deadly focus way positioning workspace.
computer facing wall, door perpendicular that. come
say, question. say yes, acknowledge
presence, wouldn't actually orient body toward me, told
conversation not going last long. no matter long stood
asked, never orient toward me, generally kept
conversations very, short. designated meetings
face-to-face. approach, confess colleagues mine used before,
not necessarily Stanford, elsewhere simply say no everything
somebody requests comes by. someone knock door,
just shout no door, someone said, can bother second?
say, no, someone said, something want tell you, just
say no. just continue person went away.
actually effective, productive people know, not
always kindest, kind. approach seen
actually approach used someone guest
Huberman Lab Podcast, someone immensely productive he,
constraining might saying he, actually, despite option

very, careful this. Now digital realm, already mentioned
things can practical tools limit interruptions. One use

01:20:01 Sit Stand, Both?

even two three hour just simply not engaged phone
all. better sit better stand work, least relates
focus productivity? answer both. There've number systematic
studies exploring called sit-stand desks. desks can set
height makes standing best practice, can lowered height
makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns
just sitting terrible us enormous number studies


pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost
pressure effects pelvic floor things sort, depending chairs
one uses. people stand slightly better situation many
health metrics improve, people combination sitting
standing desk throughout day, move one desk another,
don't combination sit-stand desk, going best. good news
easy convert sit desk stand desk, can just stack boxes,
done times stack books. also pedestals things
can purchase preference order set computer particular
height. course desks motors ones
cranks, sorts variations, terms types whether not
motors well cost things. can go low cost,
like placing boxes books create standing desk, high cost cases.
Now interesting, look scientific literature, people decreased
sitting time half day. took, say working
seven hours day, three half hours day, decide stand, not
even clear matters three hours one about, divide
shorter bouts half hour, sit half hour, et cetera,
alternating back forth showed incredibly significant effects reduced neck
shoulder pain, increase subjective health, vitality work-related environments.
perhaps importantly, sake today's discussion improvement cognitive
conditioning ability embrace new tasks cognitive performance.
several studies one wanted explore, explore detail.
put link well. article referring called "Effects Workplace
"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention Health Productivity." like paper
many papers focus effects sit-stand desks health trying
get people burn calories, improve posture, relieve neck pain, slumped over,
et cetera, not productivity. particular paper focuses also metrics

mean me? Well, long used standing desk

improve focus cognition, place within framework particular
kinds work. just review basic elements covered today.
First all, first part day, zero nine hours waking, want
bright lights, especially overhead lights, bright can keep without feeling
uncomfortable, certainly not without feeling pain eyes elsewhere
body. Bright lights will make maximum state alertness. addition, try
place, whatever focusing directly front you, not extend

call it. can, try place whatever focusing least
nose level above, might take engineering ingenuity creativity
order figure that, going beneficial. Try avoid
reclining, try avoid sitting, try stand least half work day.
good goal, may take time work goal. addition, going
use sound stimulus increasing focus alertness, trying avoid exposure
white noise, pink noise brown noise extended periods time,
hour so, might actually damaging auditory system. least,
kind stressful, even though might not notice it, kind background level
anxiety stress not going serve well. Rather, going pursue
particular types sound frequencies consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats, not
monaural beats, 40 Hertz binaural beats done particular work
30 minutes prior work about. not rely binaural beats time, every
day, think cause lose potency, just way
auditory system attenuates. actually experienced attenuation, mere
fact can go environment air conditioner, blowing,
blowing, blowing, stops, feel relaxation, weren't thinking
air conditioner before, tells auditory system kind
attenuated yet still impacting system. sensing it,
say, not perceiving it. things can improve
workspace optimization standing half day, mentioned before,
interested feel like suits treadmill, find stationary treadmill
can walk on. never tried before, maybe episode, given


read peer-reviewed research, pretty compelling, treadmilling
seems like interesting way increase alertness cognitive performance. not
sure cycling method can't imagine just cycling typing
time, sort feels like, like actually can rub here, tell pat
head kind thing. still feels like little bit sort cognitive motor collision
whatever reason, just bias. know ride bicycle,
anyway, pick preference. things order
improve workplace performance consider cathedral effect.
going analytic work part day, phase one phase two, described
them, really time day, detailed analytic work correct
answer, learning scales music, learning mathematics, trying figure solution
problem indeed solution. interpersonal problem
well, try get environment relatively low ceiling. don't
access low ceiling environment, might consider using brimmed hat even
hoodie, even just facing down, even putting hand eyes,
will, level eyebrows. words, lower ceiling, basis
cathedral effects analytic performance. contrast, interested
brainstorming, creative work, writing new things, creating new things
kind, artwork, consider getting high ceiling no ceiling environment,
wearing brimmed hat wearing hoodie, maybe peel back. Again,
data within peer reviewed literature support sorts practices.
like start layering protocols, means, please that. no
reason couldn't one just two protocols. no reason why,
instance, couldn't use binaural beats try get low ceiling

these. Now, course, enormous number things can
improve work performance productivity, talked previous

engage heightened levels focus attention. Nonetheless, treadmilling,


cycling desk, improve cognition. discussing workspace
optimization understanding not always going work
place every day. tried give set high potency tools can
improve focus cognition, place within framework particular
kinds work. just review basic elements covered today.
First all, first part day, zero nine hours waking, want
bright lights, especially overhead lights, bright can keep without feeling
uncomfortable, certainly not without feeling pain eyes elsewhere
body. Bright lights will make maximum state alertness. addition, try
place, whatever focusing directly front you, not extend
far either side eyes, try generate fairly restricted visual window
call it. can, try place whatever focusing least
nose level above, might take engineering ingenuity creativity
order figure that, going beneficial. Try avoid
reclining, try avoid sitting, try stand least half work day.
good goal, may take time work goal. addition, going
use sound stimulus increasing focus alertness, trying avoid exposure
white noise, pink noise brown noise extended periods time,
hour so, might actually damaging auditory system. least,
kind stressful, even though might not notice it, kind background level
anxiety stress not going serve well. Rather, going pursue
particular types sound frequencies consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats, not
monaural beats, 40 Hertz binaural beats done particular work
30 minutes prior work about. not rely binaural beats time, every
day, think cause lose potency, just way
auditory system attenuates. actually experienced attenuation, mere
fact can go environment air conditioner, blowing,
blowing, blowing, stops, feel relaxation, weren't thinking
air conditioner before, tells auditory system kind
attenuated yet still impacting system. sensing it,
say, not perceiving it. things can improve
workspace optimization standing half day, mentioned before,
interested feel like suits treadmill, find stationary treadmill
can walk on. never tried before, maybe episode, given


read peer-reviewed research, pretty compelling, treadmilling
seems like interesting way increase alertness cognitive performance. not
sure cycling method can't imagine just cycling typing
time, sort feels like, like actually can rub here, tell pat
head kind thing. still feels like little bit sort cognitive motor collision
whatever reason, just bias. know ride bicycle,
anyway, pick preference. things order
improve workplace performance consider cathedral effect.
going analytic work part day, phase one phase two, described
them, really time day, detailed analytic work correct
answer, learning scales music, learning mathematics, trying figure solution
problem indeed solution. interpersonal problem
well, try get environment relatively low ceiling. don't
access low ceiling environment, might consider using brimmed hat even
hoodie, even just facing down, even putting hand eyes,
will, level eyebrows. words, lower ceiling, basis
cathedral effects analytic performance. contrast, interested
brainstorming, creative work, writing new things, creating new things
kind, artwork, consider getting high ceiling no ceiling environment,
wearing brimmed hat wearing hoodie, maybe peel back. Again,
data within peer reviewed literature support sorts practices.
like start layering protocols, means, please that. no
reason couldn't one just two protocols. no reason why,
instance, couldn't use binaural beats try get low ceiling
environment detailed work couple times week, also employ
these. Now, course, enormous number things can
improve work performance productivity, talked previous
episodes, particular, episode focus episode motivation,
supplements can take can increase dopamine, instance. tools
can use increase focus, instance, focusing visual attention one

going achieve optimal focus bouts, going
achieve optimal creativity bouts. want acknowledge again, fact
realized people showing challenge workspace optimization different
budgets, different constraints. people kids home, lot
interruption, people not. Nonetheless, hope information able
provide today will allow make subtle maybe even drastic rearrangements
workspace environment. one point related that, not cover
like cover just briefly, nothing say
always work location time. can move house cafe
works you, can move office home, can also move different
locations within home. brief anecdote this. used attend lot
scientific meetings lot scientific meetings person,
always individuals seem stay engaged throughout long
meetings. talking seven, eight hour day, sometimes evening sessions,
sometimes meetings go for, four five even six days. long
meetings quality talks vary tremendously, always notice individuals
manage stay engaged awake entire meeting. noticed
people maintain high levels alertness one conference room
habit moving different seat session, sometimes even talks.
actually discussed one colleagues this, said,
conscious, always moving place place? said, yeah, just stay
one place just look one particular visual angle screen, find
one two talks, regardless interesting talks are, start take draft,
mind isn't engaged indeed, sometimes can fall asleep. started
practice moving space space, say, seat seat within
auditorium works quite well. think works quite well again,
relationship visual system driving majority cognition, visual
system drives thinking novel visual environments going lend


heightened levels alertness. Now, don't want things novel
scary threatening anxiety-provoking loud draw attention away
work. think part reason turning music moving
office cafe outdoor environment indoor environment vice versa,
maybe even within single day, can bring heightened levels productivity.
also like acknowledge covered today certainly not exhaustive

makes sitting best practice easiest practice say. turns

pointed fact people sit five six seven hours day work,
sorts issues related sleep, neck pain, cognition suffers, number
cardiovascular effects, even digestion, may even actually almost

engage heightened levels focus attention. Nonetheless, treadmilling,


cycling desk, improve cognition. discussing workspace
optimization understanding not always going work
place every day. tried give set high potency tools can
improve focus cognition, place within framework particular
kinds work. just review basic elements covered today.
First all, first part day, zero nine hours waking, want
bright lights, especially overhead lights, bright can keep without feeling
uncomfortable, certainly not without feeling pain eyes elsewhere
body. Bright lights will make maximum state alertness. addition, try
place, whatever focusing directly front you, not extend
far either side eyes, try generate fairly restricted visual window
call it. can, try place whatever focusing least
nose level above, might take engineering ingenuity creativity
order figure that, going beneficial. Try avoid
reclining, try avoid sitting, try stand least half work day.
good goal, may take time work goal. addition, going
use sound stimulus increasing focus alertness, trying avoid exposure
white noise, pink noise brown noise extended periods time,
hour so, might actually damaging auditory system. least,
kind stressful, even though might not notice it, kind background level
anxiety stress not going serve well. Rather, going pursue
particular types sound frequencies consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats, not
monaural beats, 40 Hertz binaural beats done particular work
30 minutes prior work about. not rely binaural beats time, every
day, think cause lose potency, just way
auditory system attenuates. actually experienced attenuation, mere
fact can go environment air conditioner, blowing,
blowing, blowing, stops, feel relaxation, weren't thinking
air conditioner before, tells auditory system kind
attenuated yet still impacting system. sensing it,
say, not perceiving it. things can improve
workspace optimization standing half day, mentioned before,
interested feel like suits treadmill, find stationary treadmill
can walk on. never tried before, maybe episode, given


read peer-reviewed research, pretty compelling, treadmilling
seems like interesting way increase alertness cognitive performance. not
sure cycling method can't imagine just cycling typing
time, sort feels like, like actually can rub here, tell pat
head kind thing. still feels like little bit sort cognitive motor collision
whatever reason, just bias. know ride bicycle,
anyway, pick preference. things order
improve workplace performance consider cathedral effect.
going analytic work part day, phase one phase two, described
them, really time day, detailed analytic work correct
answer, learning scales music, learning mathematics, trying figure solution
problem indeed solution. interpersonal problem
well, try get environment relatively low ceiling. don't
access low ceiling environment, might consider using brimmed hat even

cathedral effects analytic performance. contrast, interested
brainstorming, creative work, writing new things, creating new things
kind, artwork, consider getting high ceiling no ceiling environment,
wearing brimmed hat wearing hoodie, maybe peel back. Again,
data within peer reviewed literature support sorts practices.
like start layering protocols, means, please that. no
reason couldn't one just two protocols. no reason why,
instance, couldn't use binaural beats try get low ceiling

First all, first part day, zero nine hours waking, want
