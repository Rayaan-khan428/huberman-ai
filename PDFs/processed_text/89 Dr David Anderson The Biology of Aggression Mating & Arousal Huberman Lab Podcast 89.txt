00:08:10 Emotions vs. States

get free sample pack order. now discussion Dr. David
Anderson. David, great great finally sit chat you. - Great
too, thank much. - Yeah, ton questions, want start
something fairly basic, aware pretty vast landscape,
difference emotions states, indeed difference,
think emotions. they? names, happiness,
sadness, depression, anger, rage, think might
states least useful thing think about, not useful? - great. First,
short answer question see emotions type internal state,
sense arousal's also type internal state, motivation's type internal state,
sleep type internal state. sort simplest way think internal states
that, shown work, change input-to-output transformation
brain. asleep, don't hear something hear
awake, unless really, really loud noise. broad perspective, see
emotion class state controls behavior. reason think useful think
state puts focus neurobiological process rather
psychological process. gets around definitional problems people
word emotion, many people equate emotion feeling,
subjective sense can study humans, find someone's
feeling, ask them, people animals can talk, can
understand. think emotion, think iceberg, part
iceberg surface water, feeling part tip sort
floating surface consciousness. Not isn't important, is,
understand consciousness want understand feelings,



00:10:36 Dimensions States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization

not ready study animals yet, think it. -
different components state? mentioned arousal key component,
features states represent this, beautifully
put book, represent tip iceberg? - Right, right. can
break states different facets, people call dimensions,
people thought emotions just really two dimensions,
arousal dimension, intense it? also valence dimension, is,
positive negative, good bad? Ralph Adolphs tried expand little
bit think components emotion, particularly distinguish emotion
states motivational states, closely related. One
important properties persistence, something distinguishes state-driven
behaviors simple reflexes. Reflexes tend terminate stimulus turns off,
like doctor hitting knee hammer, initiates stimulus onset
terminates stimulus offset, emotions tend outlast, often, stimulus
evoke them. walking along trail Southern California, hear
rattlesnake rattling, going jump air, heart going continue
beat palms sweat mouth going dry
slithered off bush, going hypervigilant, see something
even remotely looks snake-like, stick, going stop jump. persistence
important feature emotion states, not states persistence. example,
think hunger. eaten, state gone, not hungry
anymore, really angry get fight somebody, even
fight over, may remain riled long time takes calm
down, may arousal dimension part it.
generalization important component emotion states make them,
triggered one situation, can apply another situation. favorite
example is, come home work kid screaming,
good day work, might pick sooth it, bad day work,
might react differently scream it. generalization
state triggered work, something boss said you, completely
different interaction. again, something distinguishes emotion states
motivation states, motivation states really specific, find eat food, obtain


consume water, involved homeostatic maintenance. states
multifaceted, just asking questions components states
encoded, like makes state persist? gives state positive negative
valance? crank crank intensity state? just opens
whole bunch questions

00:14:38 Arousal & Valence

can ask brain kinds tools now. - mentioned
arousal times, mentioned valence, realizing
aspects states, like just talk arousal little bit more, valence,
basic level, seems arousal, can alert pissed off,
stressed, worried, can insomnia, can also alert quite happy.
valence flips, people can sexually aroused, people can aroused sorts
ways. simple simple-ish neurochemical signature can flip valence?
instance, way can safely say arousal
additional dopamine release going positive valence, arousal low
dopamine going negative valence? - reluctant say
chemical flip, say likely circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. - Different circuits
engaged. might given neurochemical, even dopamine, involved
positively valanced arousal negatively valanced arousal, people
think different axes. think interesting question touch
is, arousal something just completely generic brain, actually
different kinds arousal specific different behaviors? raise
question, sexual arousal feels different aggressive arousal, example,
actually published paper this, back 2009, fruit flies, found
evidence two types arousal states. One sleep-wake arousal,
aroused wake asleep, flies show that,
startle response, arousal response mechanical stimulus, not just
mechanical stimulus. puff air flies, kind like trying swat wasp away
burger picnic table, come back vigorously.
able dissect show although forms arousal
required dopamine, exerted completely separable neural circuits
fly. really put, number one, emphasis circuit


determines type arousal, also arousal isn't unitary, behavior-
specific forms arousal. think jury still whether
thing completely generalized arousal not. think people argue
is, think attention needs paid question domain-specific
behavior-specific forms arousal. - Yeah, super-interesting idea, 'cause always
thought arousal along continuum, like can either panic attack
one end extreme, can coma, somewhere middle,
alert calm, issue valence really, say, presents
opportunity really might multiple circuits arousal. - Yeah. - multiple
mechanisms

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting
electrical stimulation, whereas use optogenetics, confine stimulation
just region

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

[David laughing] seem really like fire off cap gun. - Right, right. -

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something
deprived creating accumulating need, something want building
drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders

Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate

lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?

on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central

something fairly basic, aware pretty vast landscape,
difference emotions states, indeed difference,
think emotions. they? names, happiness,

short answer question see emotions type internal state,
sense arousal's also type internal state, motivation's type internal state,
sleep type internal state. sort simplest way think internal states
that, shown work, change input-to-output transformation

emotion class state controls behavior. reason think useful think
state puts focus neurobiological process rather
psychological process. gets around definitional problems people
word emotion, many people equate emotion feeling,
subjective sense can study humans, find someone's
feeling, ask them, people animals can talk, can
understand. think emotion, think iceberg, part

00:10:36 Dimensions States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization

not ready study animals yet, think it. -
different components state? mentioned arousal key component,

put book, represent tip iceberg? - Right, right. can
break states different facets, people call dimensions,
people thought emotions just really two dimensions,
arousal dimension, intense it? also valence dimension, is,
positive negative, good bad? Ralph Adolphs tried expand little
bit think components emotion, particularly distinguish emotion

important properties persistence, something distinguishes state-driven
behaviors simple reflexes. Reflexes tend terminate stimulus turns off,
like doctor hitting knee hammer, initiates stimulus onset
terminates stimulus offset, emotions tend outlast, often, stimulus

rattlesnake rattling, going jump air, heart going continue
beat palms sweat mouth going dry
slithered off bush, going hypervigilant, see something
even remotely looks snake-like, stick, going stop jump. persistence
important feature emotion states, not states persistence. example,
think hunger. eaten, state gone, not hungry
anymore, really angry get fight somebody, even
fight over, may remain riled long time takes calm
down, may arousal dimension part it.
generalization important component emotion states make them,
triggered one situation, can apply another situation. favorite
example is, come home work kid screaming,
good day work, might pick sooth it, bad day work,
might react differently scream it. generalization
state triggered work, something boss said you, completely
different interaction. again, something distinguishes emotion states
motivation states, motivation states really specific, find eat food, obtain


consume water, involved homeostatic maintenance. states
multifaceted, just asking questions components states
encoded, like makes state persist? gives state positive negative
valance? crank crank intensity state? just opens
whole bunch questions

00:14:38 Arousal & Valence

can ask brain kinds tools now. - mentioned
arousal times, mentioned valence, realizing
aspects states, like just talk arousal little bit more, valence,
basic level, seems arousal, can alert pissed off,
stressed, worried, can insomnia, can also alert quite happy.
valence flips, people can sexually aroused, people can aroused sorts
ways. simple simple-ish neurochemical signature can flip valence?
instance, way can safely say arousal
additional dopamine release going positive valence, arousal low
dopamine going negative valence? - reluctant say
chemical flip, say likely circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. - Different circuits
engaged. might given neurochemical, even dopamine, involved
positively valanced arousal negatively valanced arousal, people
think different axes. think interesting question touch
is, arousal something just completely generic brain, actually
different kinds arousal specific different behaviors? raise
question, sexual arousal feels different aggressive arousal, example,
actually published paper this, back 2009, fruit flies, found
evidence two types arousal states. One sleep-wake arousal,
aroused wake asleep, flies show that,
startle response, arousal response mechanical stimulus, not just
mechanical stimulus. puff air flies, kind like trying swat wasp away
burger picnic table, come back vigorously.
able dissect show although forms arousal
required dopamine, exerted completely separable neural circuits
fly. really put, number one, emphasis circuit


determines type arousal, also arousal isn't unitary, behavior-
specific forms arousal. think jury still whether
thing completely generalized arousal not. think people argue
is, think attention needs paid question domain-specific
behavior-specific forms arousal. - Yeah, super-interesting idea, 'cause always
thought arousal along continuum, like can either panic attack
one end extreme, can coma, somewhere middle,
alert calm, issue valence really, say, presents
opportunity really might multiple circuits arousal. - Yeah. - multiple
mechanisms

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting
electrical stimulation, whereas use optogenetics, confine stimulation
just region

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

[David laughing] seem really like fire off cap gun. - Right, right. -

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something
deprived creating accumulating need, something want building
drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders
around, put another mouse in, wham, will try mount mouse,
put kumquat cage. [Andrew laughing] try mount kumquat,
becomes sort port storm. idea drive building
pressure somehow needs released pressure actually


exerted, accept increased activity circuit circuits someplace,
pushing needs something else sort unplug Lorenz
hydraulic model? is, don't see behavior release valve
bucket let accumulated pressure flow out. one things
trying study context mating behavior well, information
object front come together drive state generated
stimulating neurons hypothalamus say, "Okay, pull trigger go,
time mate, time attack?" just starting get insights
now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context
discuss later maybe, context comfortable mental illnesses
based maladaptations fear, not mental illnesses based
maladaptations aggression pretty similar circuits brain.
imagine arousal dimension, say, stress

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest

idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.

key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical

Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see

Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work

even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault

experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us
learned. last question simple one, is, will come back
talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems
controlled causal way ever want improve psychiatric treatments
now, going require next generation people coming

Anderson. David, great great finally sit chat you. - Great
too, thank much. - Yeah, ton questions, want start
something fairly basic, aware pretty vast landscape,
difference emotions states, indeed difference,
think emotions. they? names, happiness,
sadness, depression, anger, rage, think might
states least useful thing think about, not useful? - great. First,
short answer question see emotions type internal state,
sense arousal's also type internal state, motivation's type internal state,
sleep type internal state. sort simplest way think internal states
that, shown work, change input-to-output transformation
brain. asleep, don't hear something hear
awake, unless really, really loud noise. broad perspective, see
emotion class state controls behavior. reason think useful think
state puts focus neurobiological process rather
psychological process. gets around definitional problems people
word emotion, many people equate emotion feeling,
subjective sense can study humans, find someone's
feeling, ask them, people animals can talk, can
understand. think emotion, think iceberg, part
iceberg surface water, feeling part tip sort
floating surface consciousness. Not isn't important, is,
understand consciousness want understand feelings,



00:10:36 Dimensions States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization

not ready study animals yet, think it. -
different components state? mentioned arousal key component,
features states represent this, beautifully
put book, represent tip iceberg? - Right, right. can
break states different facets, people call dimensions,
people thought emotions just really two dimensions,
arousal dimension, intense it? also valence dimension, is,
positive negative, good bad? Ralph Adolphs tried expand little
bit think components emotion, particularly distinguish emotion
states motivational states, closely related. One
important properties persistence, something distinguishes state-driven
behaviors simple reflexes. Reflexes tend terminate stimulus turns off,
like doctor hitting knee hammer, initiates stimulus onset
terminates stimulus offset, emotions tend outlast, often, stimulus
evoke them. walking along trail Southern California, hear
rattlesnake rattling, going jump air, heart going continue
beat palms sweat mouth going dry
slithered off bush, going hypervigilant, see something
even remotely looks snake-like, stick, going stop jump. persistence
important feature emotion states, not states persistence. example,
think hunger. eaten, state gone, not hungry
anymore, really angry get fight somebody, even
fight over, may remain riled long time takes calm
down, may arousal dimension part it.
generalization important component emotion states make them,
triggered one situation, can apply another situation. favorite
example is, come home work kid screaming,
good day work, might pick sooth it, bad day work,
might react differently scream it. generalization
state triggered work, something boss said you, completely
different interaction. again, something distinguishes emotion states
motivation states, motivation states really specific, find eat food, obtain


consume water, involved homeostatic maintenance. states
multifaceted, just asking questions components states
encoded, like makes state persist? gives state positive negative
valance? crank crank intensity state? just opens
whole bunch questions

00:14:38 Arousal & Valence

can ask brain kinds tools now. - mentioned
arousal times, mentioned valence, realizing
aspects states, like just talk arousal little bit more, valence,
basic level, seems arousal, can alert pissed off,
stressed, worried, can insomnia, can also alert quite happy.
valence flips, people can sexually aroused, people can aroused sorts
ways. simple simple-ish neurochemical signature can flip valence?
instance, way can safely say arousal
additional dopamine release going positive valence, arousal low
dopamine going negative valence? - reluctant say
chemical flip, say likely circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. - Different circuits
engaged. might given neurochemical, even dopamine, involved
positively valanced arousal negatively valanced arousal, people
think different axes. think interesting question touch
is, arousal something just completely generic brain, actually
different kinds arousal specific different behaviors? raise
question, sexual arousal feels different aggressive arousal, example,
actually published paper this, back 2009, fruit flies, found
evidence two types arousal states. One sleep-wake arousal,
aroused wake asleep, flies show that,
startle response, arousal response mechanical stimulus, not just
mechanical stimulus. puff air flies, kind like trying swat wasp away
burger picnic table, come back vigorously.
able dissect show although forms arousal
required dopamine, exerted completely separable neural circuits
fly. really put, number one, emphasis circuit


determines type arousal, also arousal isn't unitary, behavior-
specific forms arousal. think jury still whether
thing completely generalized arousal not. think people argue
is, think attention needs paid question domain-specific
behavior-specific forms arousal. - Yeah, super-interesting idea, 'cause always
thought arousal along continuum, like can either panic attack
one end extreme, can coma, somewhere middle,
alert calm, issue valence really, say, presents
opportunity really might multiple circuits arousal. - Yeah. - multiple
mechanisms

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting
electrical stimulation, whereas use optogenetics, confine stimulation
just region

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something

gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly

animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders

fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate

obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context

maladaptations aggression pretty similar circuits brain.
imagine arousal dimension, say, stress

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little

just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.

spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans

"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going

get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists

started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault
spinal cord. - Yeah. - body back forth, okay. think


body, terms states? point, love comment heat
map experiment, seem regularity people
experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab

talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people

00:10:36 Dimensions States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization

not ready study animals yet, think it. -
different components state? mentioned arousal key component,
features states represent this, beautifully
put book, represent tip iceberg? - Right, right. can
break states different facets, people call dimensions,
people thought emotions just really two dimensions,
arousal dimension, intense it? also valence dimension, is,
positive negative, good bad? Ralph Adolphs tried expand little
bit think components emotion, particularly distinguish emotion
states motivational states, closely related. One
important properties persistence, something distinguishes state-driven
behaviors simple reflexes. Reflexes tend terminate stimulus turns off,
like doctor hitting knee hammer, initiates stimulus onset
terminates stimulus offset, emotions tend outlast, often, stimulus
evoke them. walking along trail Southern California, hear
rattlesnake rattling, going jump air, heart going continue
beat palms sweat mouth going dry
slithered off bush, going hypervigilant, see something
even remotely looks snake-like, stick, going stop jump. persistence
important feature emotion states, not states persistence. example,
think hunger. eaten, state gone, not hungry
anymore, really angry get fight somebody, even
fight over, may remain riled long time takes calm
down, may arousal dimension part it.
generalization important component emotion states make them,
triggered one situation, can apply another situation. favorite
example is, come home work kid screaming,
good day work, might pick sooth it, bad day work,
might react differently scream it. generalization
state triggered work, something boss said you, completely
different interaction. again, something distinguishes emotion states
motivation states, motivation states really specific, find eat food, obtain


consume water, involved homeostatic maintenance. states
multifaceted, just asking questions components states
encoded, like makes state persist? gives state positive negative
valance? crank crank intensity state? just opens
whole bunch questions

00:14:38 Arousal & Valence

can ask brain kinds tools now. - mentioned
arousal times, mentioned valence, realizing
aspects states, like just talk arousal little bit more, valence,
basic level, seems arousal, can alert pissed off,
stressed, worried, can insomnia, can also alert quite happy.
valence flips, people can sexually aroused, people can aroused sorts
ways. simple simple-ish neurochemical signature can flip valence?
instance, way can safely say arousal
additional dopamine release going positive valence, arousal low
dopamine going negative valence? - reluctant say
chemical flip, say likely circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. - Different circuits
engaged. might given neurochemical, even dopamine, involved
positively valanced arousal negatively valanced arousal, people
think different axes. think interesting question touch
is, arousal something just completely generic brain, actually
different kinds arousal specific different behaviors? raise
question, sexual arousal feels different aggressive arousal, example,
actually published paper this, back 2009, fruit flies, found
evidence two types arousal states. One sleep-wake arousal,
aroused wake asleep, flies show that,
startle response, arousal response mechanical stimulus, not just
mechanical stimulus. puff air flies, kind like trying swat wasp away
burger picnic table, come back vigorously.
able dissect show although forms arousal
required dopamine, exerted completely separable neural circuits
fly. really put, number one, emphasis circuit


determines type arousal, also arousal isn't unitary, behavior-
specific forms arousal. think jury still whether
thing completely generalized arousal not. think people argue
is, think attention needs paid question domain-specific
behavior-specific forms arousal. - Yeah, super-interesting idea, 'cause always
thought arousal along continuum, like can either panic attack
one end extreme, can coma, somewhere middle,
alert calm, issue valence really, say, presents
opportunity really might multiple circuits arousal. - Yeah. - multiple
mechanisms

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting
electrical stimulation, whereas use optogenetics, confine stimulation
just region

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier

ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work

castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass

say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,

'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,

not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -

felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive

Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault
spinal cord. - Yeah. - body back forth, okay. think


body, terms states? point, love comment heat
map experiment, seem regularity people
experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us
learned. last question simple one, is, will come back
talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems
controlled causal way ever want improve psychiatric treatments
now, going require next generation people coming

consume water, involved homeostatic maintenance. states
multifaceted, just asking questions components states
encoded, like makes state persist? gives state positive negative
valance? crank crank intensity state? just opens
whole bunch questions

00:14:38 Arousal & Valence

can ask brain kinds tools now. - mentioned
arousal times, mentioned valence, realizing
aspects states, like just talk arousal little bit more, valence,
basic level, seems arousal, can alert pissed off,
stressed, worried, can insomnia, can also alert quite happy.
valence flips, people can sexually aroused, people can aroused sorts
ways. simple simple-ish neurochemical signature can flip valence?
instance, way can safely say arousal
additional dopamine release going positive valence, arousal low
dopamine going negative valence? - reluctant say
chemical flip, say likely circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. - Different circuits
engaged. might given neurochemical, even dopamine, involved
positively valanced arousal negatively valanced arousal, people
think different axes. think interesting question touch
is, arousal something just completely generic brain, actually
different kinds arousal specific different behaviors? raise
question, sexual arousal feels different aggressive arousal, example,
actually published paper this, back 2009, fruit flies, found
evidence two types arousal states. One sleep-wake arousal,
aroused wake asleep, flies show that,
startle response, arousal response mechanical stimulus, not just
mechanical stimulus. puff air flies, kind like trying swat wasp away
burger picnic table, come back vigorously.
able dissect show although forms arousal
required dopamine, exerted completely separable neural circuits
fly. really put, number one, emphasis circuit


determines type arousal, also arousal isn't unitary, behavior-
specific forms arousal. think jury still whether
thing completely generalized arousal not. think people argue
is, think attention needs paid question domain-specific
behavior-specific forms arousal. - Yeah, super-interesting idea, 'cause always
thought arousal along continuum, like can either panic attack
one end extreme, can coma, somewhere middle,
alert calm, issue valence really, say, presents
opportunity really might multiple circuits arousal. - Yeah. - multiple
mechanisms

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting
electrical stimulation, whereas use optogenetics, confine stimulation
just region

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something
deprived creating accumulating need, something want building
drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders

now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask

00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression Mice, VMH

include neurochemicals, well different neural pathways. - Yeah. -
like talk bit state, indeed state, aggression, labs
worked extensively this. would, highlight key
findings there, brain areas involved? beautiful work Dayu Lin
others lab point idea indeed kind switches
brain, thinking switches aggression might simple,
think aggression? just sort skew question bit saying,
see lots different kinds aggression, terrible school shooting Texas
recently, clearly act included aggression, yet, imagine
different type aggression all-out rage controlled aggression, lot
variation there. thoughts aggression, generated,
neural circuit mechanisms variation call aggression? - Yeah,
great question, large area. say that, first all, word
aggression, mind, refers description behavior
internal state. Aggression reflect internal state call anger
humans, reflect fear, reflect hunger predatory aggression.
gets issue raised different types aggression exist.
work Dayu lab really broke open field
application modern genetic tools studying circuits mice found way
evoke aggression mice using optogenetics activate specific neurons region
hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, people


studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear

like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting

Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release

example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region

state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier

think case aggression, data others show strongly

animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas

fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't

ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating

everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain

not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running

projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face

martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating

analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little

spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault

experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab

talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness

studying looking decades, following, first, work of, cats, famous
Nobel Prize-winning work Walter Hess, followed work done Menno
Kruk, Netherlands, rats, stick electrical wires brain
send electric currents brain, trigger placid cat suddenly
bare teeth, hiss almost strike experimenter, trigger rats
fight other. even Hess's original experiments, describes two types
aggression evokes cats depending hypothalamus
puts electrode, one calls defensive rage, ears laid back, teeth
bared hissing. one predatory aggression, cat ears
forward, batting paw mouse-like object, like wants catch
eat it. already had, stage, information segregation brain
different forms aggression. fast forward 2008, 2009, Dayu came
lab started working aggression fruit flies, wanted bring
mice apply genetic tools. started Dayu,
electrophysiologist, just repeat electrical stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus mouse, just like people done rats, cats, hamsters, even
monkeys. not get experiment work 40 different trials, just
didn't work. got instead fear behaviors, got freezing, cornering
crouching. finally, desperation, got lot input Menno Kruk this,
really mystified, "Why doesn't work mice?" realized
no paper brain-stimulated aggression mice 50 years, 'cause experiment
doesn't work. one bit credit can claim convinced Dayu try
optogenetics, just sort come use deep brain, Karl
Deisseroth others' work. thought maybe directed
specifically region brain types cells electrical stimulation, might
work. Dayu said, "Never, never going work. doesn't work electricity,
work optogenetics?" fact work, able
trigger aggression region using optogenetic stimulation ventromedial
hypothalamus. retrospect, think reason seeing fear
behaviors right upper part, think ventromedial hypothalamus
like pear sitting ground, fat part pear near ground
aggression neurons are, upper part pear fear neurons.
small mouse, inject electrical current anywhere
pear, flows entire pear activates fear circuits, totally


dominate aggression. never able see fighting

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something

drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders
around, put another mouse in, wham, will try mount mouse,
put kumquat cage. [Andrew laughing] try mount kumquat,

trying study context mating behavior well, information
object front come together drive state generated

time mate, time attack?" just starting get insights
now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH

know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context
discuss later maybe, context comfortable mental illnesses

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work

unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice

now let pups, put male another male mouse

presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain

students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls

never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,

fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition

mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,

also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator

violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew

pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting

pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel

heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain

00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory

implanted channelrhodopsin gene neurons. fast
forward that, lot work Dayu now NYU,
postdoc, Annegret Falkner, well work people, evidence
type fighting elicit stimulate VMH offensive aggression
actually rewarding male mice. - like it. - like it, male mice will learn poke
nose press bar get opportunity beat subordinate male mouse.
recent experiments, activate neurons mouse
chance one two compartments box, will gravitate towards
compartment neurons activated, positive valance.
went field thinking, "Well, goes brain body
furious?" certainly doesn't feel like rewarding experience, not something
want repeat feels good state, doesn't feel
good state. still, think, mystery type
aggression, defensive aggression, kind aggression feel
attacked cheated somebody, encoded
brain works, still, think, important mystery haven't solved.
predatory aggression progress on, mice show predatory
aggression, use catch crickets eat, involves different
circuits ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. become clear that,
want call state aggressiveness, multifaceted, depends type
aggression involves different sorts circuits. paper suggesting
might final common pathway aggression region, one
favorites, called substantia innominata, substance no name, like. -
Anatomists creative. - Yes. [Andrew laughing] nucleus ambiguous,
zona incerta, places no one can think are. Anyhow,
might final common pathway predatory aggression, offensive defensive
aggression, can really hard tell just looking mouse fight whether
engaged offensive defensive aggression. tried take apart using


machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

[David laughing] seem really like fire off cap gun. - Right, right. -

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something
deprived creating accumulating need, something want building
drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders
around, put another mouse in, wham, will try mount mouse,
put kumquat cage. [Andrew laughing] try mount kumquat,
becomes sort port storm. idea drive building
pressure somehow needs released pressure actually


exerted, accept increased activity circuit circuits someplace,
pushing needs something else sort unplug Lorenz
hydraulic model? is, don't see behavior release valve
bucket let accumulated pressure flow out. one things
trying study context mating behavior well, information
object front come together drive state generated
stimulating neurons hypothalamus say, "Okay, pull trigger go,
time mate, time attack?" just starting get insights
now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context
discuss later maybe, context comfortable mental illnesses
based maladaptations fear, not mental illnesses based
maladaptations aggression pretty similar circuits brain.
imagine arousal dimension, say, stress
hormones activated, regions, VMH projects 30 different regions
brain, gets input 30 different regions. kind see
antenna broadcasting center, like satellite dish takes information
different sensory modalities, smell, maybe vision, mechanosensation,
sort synthesizes integrates fairly low-dimensional, computational
people call it, representation pressure attack, broadcasts

engage in, wind losing wind getting killed, brain
constantly make cost-benefit analysis whether continue path
back off well. think part broadcasting function region


engaging brain domains

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts

pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating

point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.

spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate

started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault
spinal cord. - Yeah. - body back forth, okay. think


body, terms states? point, love comment heat
map experiment, seem regularity people
experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us
learned. last question simple one, is, will come back
talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems
controlled causal way ever want improve psychiatric treatments
now, going require next generation people coming


field. - Absolutely, second that.

machine learning analysis behavior, rats, example, much clearer
animal engaged offensive versus defensive aggression. direct bites
different parts opponent's body. - [Andrew] particular. - Offensive aggression
flank directed, defensive aggression goes neck, goes throat. - Mm,
seen nature specials barbaric way, [laughing] least me,
seems, like hyenas will try go reproductive axis, go testicles
penis basically want to, seems want limit future breeding potential. -
Yes, create pain. [David laughing] - Right, create pain, both. - Yeah. - Yeah,
mean, terms offensive aggression reflection doesn't feel good,
mean, can say, know people really enjoy fighting. - [David] Hmm. -
relative lawyer, loves argue fight. - [David] Huh. - don't think
physically aggressive, fact, not, loves fight loves prosecute
go people. - Hmm. - pretty effective it. - Right. - friend, former
military special operations, calm guy, great career military special
operations, quite plainly say, "I love fight." - Mm-hmm. - "It's one great
joys." really enjoyed work. - [David] Yep. - also respected side
offered opportunity test experience joy. kind
bizarre way somebody like me, certainly defend stance need to. -
Yeah. - certainly don't consider somebody offensively goes people
just go them, no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here.

00:29:20 Evolution & Development Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear

- Right. - Acknowledging dopamine many things, course. - Yeah. -
couple questions way describe circuitry, say, way
circuitry arranged. - [David] Mm-hmm. - course, don't know,
weren't consulted design phase. [David laughing] think
close positioning neurons can elicit divergent states
behaviors? mean, talking pear-shaped structure, neurons
generate fear cheek jowl neurons generate offensive aggression
things. like putting neurons control swallowing next neurons
control vomiting, [laughing] just seems that, one hand, way
neural circuits often arranged, yet, me, always perplexing
case. - Yeah, think profound question,


wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power
comments cap gun.

example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region

state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly

wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders

now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH

know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal

aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many

think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen

truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little

just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.

spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice

aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds

wondered lot. think evolutionary perspective, might
case defensive behaviors fear arose offensive aggression,
animals, first foremost, defend predation
animals. maybe comfortable warded off predation
made safe, can start think about, "Who's going
alpha male group here?" think brain regions
cell populations evolve duplication modification preexisting cell populations,
might way regions wound next other.
developmentally, start common pool precursors expresses
gene, fear neurons aggression neurons, development,
gets shut off aggression neurons maintained fear neurons. Now,
view says, "Oh, accident evolution development," think must
functional part well. one thing know offensive aggression strong
fear shuts down, whereas defensive aggression, least rats, actually enhanced
fear. one big differences defensive aggression offensive
aggression. think it, offensive aggression rewarding
pleasurable, start get really scared, tends take fun it,
maybe two regions close facilitate inhibition aggression
fear neurons. know fact deliberately stimulate fear neurons
top pear, two animals involved fight, just stops fight
dead tracks go off corner freeze. least hierarchically,
seems like fear dominant behavior offensive aggression,
inhibition work not clear, 'cause neurons pretty much excitatory,
almost glutamatergic. one interesting questions future is,
exactly fear dominate shut offensive aggression brain?
work, circuitry, chemicals involved?
mechanism called play? think way tend think
neurons mixed together. not just fight freezing, fight
flight, also metabolic neurons mixed together VMH well. -
Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - interesting. -
neurons respond glucose, glucose goes bloodstream,
activated, VMH whole history field obesity,
destroy rat, get fat rat. way world thinks VMH
think about, "Oh, thing keeps getting fat." anti-


obesity area, area social behavior, see center control
aggression fear behaviors. again, neurons functions, like
call four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting mating. - Mm-hmm. -
seem closely intermingled other, maybe crosstalk
important help animal's brain decide behavior prioritize
behavior shut given moment. - One things will
link incredible videos mice selective stimulation neurons
VMH, Dayu's studies done. Whenever teach, show
videos point, caveats warnings required one
see video mouse trying mate another mouse, mating another
mouse, seem quite happy mating experience, least
far know, observers mice. upon stimulation VMH neurons,
one mice essentially tries kill mouse. stimulation
stopped, basically go back hanging out. don't go right back mating. -
Right. - reconciliation clearly needs [laughing] happen first,
assume. - Yes. - just striking, think equally striking video
mouse alone glove, VMH neurons stimulated mouse
goes rage, looks like wants kill glove, basically. - Yep. - striking,
encourage people go watch those, really puts tremendous amount
color describing,

00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures States & Homeostasis

just idea switches brain, me, really became clear upon
seeing that. One the, excuse me, one concepts raised
lectures think Hess's idea idea sort hydraulic
pressure. - Mm-hmm. - maybe Konrad, can't speak now. [David laughing]
Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, pardon. - Mm-hmm. - talked kind hydraulic
pressure towards behavior. fascinated idea hydraulic pressure,
don't consider hot-tempered person, familiar fact
lose temper, takes quite simmer down. can't think anything
else, don't want think anything else. fact, trying think anything else
becomes aversive me, which, me, underscores notion prioritization
different states. - Mm-hmm. - potentially conflicting states. think


funnels idea hydraulic pressure toward state? it, perhaps,
sometimes can angry, succeed winning argument,
sudden, will subside? clearly means external influences,
complex space creating, realize creating bit cloud. -
Yeah. - purpose, because, me, idea hydraulic pressure
towards state, like sleep, sleep pressure. - Yeah. - pressure
towards aggression, makes sense, involved? multifactorial
actually separate variables, really driving hydraulic pressure toward
given state? - Yeah, really important question, think one way helpful, least
me, break question apart think distinguish homeostatic
behaviors, is, need-based behaviors, pressure built
need, like, "I'm hungry, need eat. thirsty, need drink. hot, need get
cold place," basically thermostat model brain. set point,
temperature gets hot, turn AC, temperature gets
cold, turn heater put back set point. don't think
aggression works. is, not go around, least subjectively, don't
go around accumulating need fight, look excuse release
it. Now, maybe people that, go look bar fights
get to. - Twitter. - Yeah, [laughing] Twitter, yeah. - Twitter seems to, sort
half joking, Twitter seems draw reasonably sized crowd people
combat sort, even though total intellectual power

accumulated hydraulic pressure either based something
deprived creating accumulating need, something want building
drive pressure that, natural way think that, least me,
gradual increases neural activity particular region brain.
example, area hypothalamus controls feeding, Scott Sternson
others shown hungrier get, higher level activity region
brain, eat, boom, activity goes right back again.
state actually negatively valenced, like animal, quote-unquote, feels
increasingly uncomfortable, just like feel increasingly uncomfortable hungrier
are, eat, tamps down, increased activity.
think case aggression, data others show strongly
drive region brain optogenetically, just hair trigger need
set animal off get fight. Now, interesting thing nothing
animal attack, doesn't really much stimulating region. sort
wanders around cage little bit more, will not actually show overt attack
unless put something front it. thing true areas
described control mating behavior. Lindsay working on, can
stimulate areas 'til blue face, mouse just sort wanders
around, put another mouse in, wham, will try mount mouse,
put kumquat cage. [Andrew laughing] try mount kumquat,
becomes sort port storm. idea drive building
pressure somehow needs released pressure actually


exerted, accept increased activity circuit circuits someplace,
pushing needs something else sort unplug Lorenz
hydraulic model? is, don't see behavior release valve
bucket let accumulated pressure flow out. one things
trying study context mating behavior well, information
object front come together drive state generated
stimulating neurons hypothalamus say, "Okay, pull trigger go,
time mate, time attack?" just starting get insights
now. - Fascinating, mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay,
Lindsay former graduate student mine now postdoc David's lab.
haven't caught recently hear experiments, sound
fascinating. love spend time issue mouse won't
attack nothing, it'll attack even glove, will try mate
another mouse mate with? actually, think, fortunately you, not spending
lot time Twitter Instagram YouTube, whole online
community exists now, far know, almost exclusively young males
obsessed idea, just say it, name, called NoFap, no
masturbation way maintain motivation go actually seek mates.
ready availability online pornography. - Huh. - probably
much larger population young males never actually going seeking
mates getting porn addicted, et cetera. actually serious issue
came episode Anna Lembke, wrote book "Dopamine Nation".
- Hmm. - availability pornography, whole social context
created around this, genuine addiction. humans not like mice,
mice not like humans, humans seem resolve issue own. - Yeah. -
ways might actually impede seeking finding sexual partners and/or long-
term mates. - Right. - serious issue there, raise serious issue. - Yep. -
hear lot about, 'cause get asked hundreds not thousands questions this,
"Is physiological basis call NoFap?" never actually reply
'cause no data. - [David] Yep. - raising

00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression

interesting mechanistic scenario can, mentioned,


explored. know internal state mouse whose VMH
stimulated mouse whose brain region can stimulate desire mate,
know internal state mouse just alone cage
wandering around? iI wandering around really wanting mate really wanting
fight? We, course, don't know, heart rate up, blood pressure up?
wishing pornography? [David Andrew laughing] Something's going
on, presumably, different prior stimulation, arousal?
think visual factory perception conspecific ungates
tremendous repertoire behaviors? - Right, central question. can say, least
respect fear neurons sit top aggression neurons, know
neurons activated optogenetically, way activate
aggression neurons, clearly arousal process occurring, can
see pupils dilate animal. increase stress hormone release
bloodstream, shown heart rate goes up. addition drive
actually freeze, animals do, autonomic arousal
neuroendocrine activation stress responses. probably shared
aggression neurons mating neurons, although haven't investigated
much detail, wouldn't surprised project many
regions fear neurons project to, interesting issue context
discuss later maybe, context comfortable mental illnesses
based maladaptations fear, not mental illnesses based
maladaptations aggression pretty similar circuits brain.
imagine arousal dimension, say, stress
hormones activated, regions, VMH projects 30 different regions
brain, gets input 30 different regions. kind see
antenna broadcasting center, like satellite dish takes information
different sensory modalities, smell, maybe vision, mechanosensation,
sort synthesizes integrates fairly low-dimensional, computational
people call it, representation pressure attack, broadcasts

engaging brain domains

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central

think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control

counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered

aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think

reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage

idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company

many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,

pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew

failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings

"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known

unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice

now let pups, put male another male mouse

presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain

students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls

never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present

mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?

'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love

also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative

suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems

control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator

violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew

pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating

Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons

tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically

aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work
colleague, Nirao Shah, Stanford, one former PhD students,
castrate mouse loses ability fight, not can rescue fighting
testosterone implant, can rescue estrogen implant. can bypass
completely requirement testosterone restore aggressiveness mice.
say, many effects testosterone, although not all, many
mediated conversion estrogen, process called aromatization,
carried enzyme called aromatase. fact, listeners may
heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production
estrogen preventing testosterone converted estrogen. fact,
lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think

reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see

whole biology remains explored much

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating

distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall

make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots

also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will

00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone

play role kind cost-benefit analysis. - want talk mating
behavior, segue that, talking aggression mating behavior,
think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control
aggression molecular marker, found marker estrogen
receptor. might strike little strange, aggression-promoting
neurons male mice labeled estrogen receptor? labs shown
estrogen receptor adult male mice necessary aggression. knock
gene VMH, don't fight. shown, lot work

heard aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors widely used female humans


adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. way reducing production

lot animal experiments showing give males aromatase inhibitors,
stop fighting, well also stop sexually active. one
counterintuitive ideas, Nirao shown progesterone also seems play role
aggression, aggression neurons also express progesterone
receptor. two hormones classically thought female
reproductive hormones, goes goes estrous cycle,
estrogen progesterone, yet, playing important role controlling
aggression male mice, presumably male humans well. - Fascinating,
estrogen many things think people believe. - Yep. -
testosterone

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population
neurons male female flies, females, activates female-specific
fighting neurons, males, activates male-specific fighting neurons, kind
hierarchy common neuron top. mice, discovered
male-specific neurons VMH, neurons activated male
aggression. Now, neurons active females females fight VMH
not sex specific, also found males. already showing
complexity, male mouse VMH male-specific aggression neurons
generic aggression neurons. female VMH, mating cells found
females, female specific not found male brain. trying
find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think
experiments people tried to, classical experiments, people tried
reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see
can make aggressive. manipulations do, extent,
whole biology remains explored much
hormones, much circuitry electricity,

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now

Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,

'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain

not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,

martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide

peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know

inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating

spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers

called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage

think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us

talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems

think, "Hormones." whenever opportunity podcast shatter
common myth, grab it. One common myths there, think
persists, testosterone makes animals humans aggressive, estrogen
makes animals placid kind emotional. know, nothing
truth, although truth idea hormones
involved. Robert Sapolsky supplied information came
podcast, give people exogenous testosterone, tends make
way before. jerk before, become jerk,
altruistic, become altruistic. eventually pointed out,
"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays
role generating aggression, however, specific hormones involved
generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little
bit that? 'Cause interesting surprises there. - Yeah,
really important question. finally identified neurons VMH control

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,

find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think

reproduce changes hormones occur pregnancy female rats see

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems

particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide

peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know

inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating

distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green

make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,

sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,

"You'll aromatize testosterone estrogen start getting opposite effects,"
murky space, not straightforward. not mistaken, testosterone plays

generating aggression via VMH things testosterone. Can tell us little

00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much
ready fight drop hat, female mice fight nurturing
nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes
virginity maternity. recently showed paper, work one
students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,
recently, discovered set female-specific fighting neurons female brain,
together couple laboratories. Now, share one common population

find sex-specific populations neurons doing, indicates
mechanism different sexes show different behaviors. -
fixated transition virgin female mouse maternal female mouse,
couple questions whether not, instance, transition
governed presence pups. instance, take virgin female,
mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different
conspecifics. require lactation? don't know answer that, think

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive

kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never

appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,

competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting

Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot

interesting long ago, look true fetishes,

bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central

maybe different fewer things cases, others. known
aggressive females time alive, involved female aggression
unique pathways generate male aggression? - Great question,
labs studied mice also fruit flies. one thing mice
distinguishes aggression females males male mice pretty much

nursing pups delivered litter. window
become hyper-aggressive, pups weened, aggressiveness
goes away. pretty remarkable take virgin female mouse expose
male, response become sexually receptive mate him.
now let pups, put male another male mouse
cage her, instead trying mate him, attacks him.
presumably hormonal also neuronal switch occurring brain
switches response female sex aggression goes

students, Mengyu Liu, within VMH females, two clearly divisible subsets
estrogen receptor neurons, showed one subsets controls
fighting one controls mating. fact, stimulate fighting-
specific subset virgin, can get virgin attack, something


never able before, stimulate mating one, enhance mating.
reason never get results stimulated whole population
estrogen receptor neurons effects opposite cancel out.
turns measure activity fighting mating neurons
going virgin maternal female, aggression neurons low
activity virgin, female pups, activation ability neurons
goes way mating neurons stay same. think balance
like seesaw, virgin, activity mating neurons
fighting neurons, whereas nursing mother, activity
activation way around, fighting neurons mating. - Mm-hmm. -
say, "Fighting mating," first? Mating neurons dominate fighting virgin,
fighting neurons dominate mating mother. really cool observation,
not something happens males, don't know causes
controls that. Interestingly, gets whole issue neurons present
females, not males. field known long time male female
fruit flies sex-specific neurons. neurons identified fruit
flies control fighting males male specific, not found female brain,

mate male, pups, try fight male, presumably


another intruder female, right? - Yes, equally towards females male intruders. -
require presence pups? Meaning take pups
give another mother, revert virgin-like behavior?
triggered lactation actually triggered mating behavior itself?
'Cause possible virgin become non-virgin, not actually litter
pups. - Right, great questions, don't know answer
them. can say nursing mother doesn't pups
cage order attack intruder male intruder female, just state
brain makes aggressive intruder. aggression neurons
female's brain activated male female intruders equally, whereas male
mice, aggression neurons ever activated males, not females,
males never supposed attack females, supposed mate them.
another difference neurons tuned signals different

00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors

much factors haven't identified yet? - don't want
anthropomorphize, but, well, just ask question. day, watching
ferrets mate, right? mustelids, mating behavior, guess didn't say
watching this, doesn't matter. [David laughing] simply doesn't matter,
one observes mating behaviors different animals, know
tremendous range mating behaviors humans. can no aggressive
component, aggressive component humans sorts
kinks fetishes behaviors, probably never
documented 'cause happens private. here, always say
podcast, time talking sexual behavior humans, always making
presumption consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate species
appropriate. Well, today, talking lot different species. said, just


set context, watching video ferrets mating, quite violent actually.
lot neck biting, lot squealing. going project
anthropomorphize, say not really clear want there, one
make assumption. course, don't know, no idea,
ritual. seems, me, crossover aggression mating behavior
circuitry act mating, think reflects sort stew
competing neurons prioritizing real time? Because, course, states,
persistence, point out, can imagine states overlapping, four
different states, motivational drive mate, motivational drive get away
experience, motivational drive eat point, defecate point,
things competing, really seeing bias probabilities.
look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal
populations animal might kind confused going on? -
Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers

provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists

think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological

think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab

neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,
subset neurons activated females male-female mating encounters.
Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot
superficially looks like violent behavior sometimes, especially female rejects
male runs away. evidence female-selective neurons
VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male
aggression neurons. think must reason VMH not
traditionally brain region male sexual behavior assigned.
another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating
neurons male middle attacking another male, will stop fighting,
start singing male start try mount male shut neurons
off. make-love-not-war neurons, VMH make-war-not-love


neurons, dense interconnections two nuclei,
close brain. shown connections
mutually inhibitory, prevent animal attacking mate supposed
mating with, prevent mating animal supposed attacking.
also possible cooperative interactions structures,
well antagonistic interactions, balance whether cooperative
antagonistic interactions firing given moment mating encounter,
suggest, may determine whether moment coital bliss among two lions may
suddenly turn snap growl baring fangs.

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show

aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,

think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings

interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage

talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological

think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab

look mating behavior various animals, see aggressive component
sometimes, not always. species specific, context specific?
generally, think crosstalk different neuronal

Right, great questions. can't really speak issue whether species specific,
'cause not naturalist zoologist. seen, like have, wild,
example, lions mate, seen Africa, often biting
component well. One things surprised us identified
neurons VMHvl control aggression males within population,

Now, don't generally think mouse sex rough sex, lot

VMH part mating behavior. shut 'em down, animals don't mate
effectively otherwise would. happens stimulate don't
yet know don't way specifically without activating male

another area called medial preoptic area, shown
neurons definitely stimulate mating behavior. fact, activate mating

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive

might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations

make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive

agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know

naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors

mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage

idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company

talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone

intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us

talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems

01:05:10 Neurobiology Sexual Fetishes

don't know that, certainly substrate, wiring happen. -
sure people's minds running wild this. just use opportunity
raise something wondered far long, [laughing] is, friend
psychiatrist works treatment fetishes. not psychiatrist
treated by, just point out. [David laughing] mentioned something
interesting long ago, look true fetishes,
meets criteria fetish, seem some, one think
competing circuitry suddenly becomes aligned. instance, avoidance
feces, dead bodies, feet, things infectious, typically states disgust
antagonistic states desire, one hope present sexual
behavior. Fetishes often involve exactly things aversive, feet, dead
bodies, disgusting things people, true fetishes, pathologic sense, exist
people have, basically, requirement thinking even presence
ordinarily disgusting things order become sexually aroused. - Hmm. -
circuitry crossed over, statement wrung mind people don't
develop fetishes mailboxes, color red, random objects things,
develop fetishes things highly infectious counter-reproductive appetitive
states. - Hmm. - find interesting, don't know reflections
might be. tempted ask whether not ever observed fetish-
like behavior mice, find fascinating area brain
highly concerned hypothalamus, dense populations
intermixed, addition forebrain, especially humans, can think


make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may

really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people

something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate

started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault
spinal cord. - Yeah. - body back forth, okay. think


body, terms states? point, love comment heat
map experiment, seem regularity people
experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us
learned. last question simple one, is, will come back
talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems
controlled causal way ever want improve psychiatric treatments
now, going require next generation people coming


field. - Absolutely, second that.

make decisions ways facilitate expression primitive
behaviors, also complicate expression primitive behaviors. - Right,
agree. think one way looking fetishes neurobiological standpoint
represent kind appetitive conditioning something natively
aversive disgusting, repeatedly paired rewarding experience, changes
valence, sign now somehow produces anticipation reward next
time person sees it. Now, don't know literature animals, don't know
condition mouse eat feces, example, although animals
naturally coprophagic, maybe mice occasionally, not sure. one
way think it, certainly involve humans, recently
evolved arts brain, cortex sort orchestrating behaviors
happening whether reward states turning association behaviors
happening. part think difficult challenging study
mouse, certainly bears thinking about, really interesting, again, sort
counterintuitive aspect. Again, like rough sex, people want fighting,
violence, aggressiveness order sexually aroused, fetishes. fact,
made discovery initially, raised question mind whether
people serial rapists, example, engage sexual violence might,
level, wires crossed way, states supposed
pretty much separated mutually antagonistic not, actually
rewarding reinforcing. think going long time figured
out, think it, no treatment violent sexual
offender eliminates violence, not sexual desire sexual urge, whether
physical castration chemical castration, eliminates both. - Definitely area
think, well, human neuroscience general

01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression

needs lot tools, right? terms probe manipulate neural circuitry.
love turn area mentioned, medial preoptic area. fascinated
it, just within VMH, neurons mating fighting,
aggression, understanding medial preoptic area contains neurons mating,
also temperature regulation. perhaps making much leap here,
always wondered phrase, "In heat," certainly menstrual


estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab

estrous cycle females related changes body temperature. fact, measuring
body temperature one way women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
Although not show contraception, please rely multiple methods
[laughing] necessary, don't use discussion guide contraception based
temperature. stimulate certain neurons medial preoptic area, can
trigger dramatic changes body temperature and/or mating behavior.
relationship, any, temperature mating, simply not know? - don't
know relationship temperature mating neurons preoptic
area. suspect different populations neurons become pretty
clear preoptic area many different subsets neurons specifically
active different behaviors, even different phases mating behavior.
mounting neurons, intromission thrusting neurons, ejaculation neurons
sniffing neurons. - Wait, wait, think heard before, just want make
sure people get want make sure get this. telling within
medial preoptic area, specific neurons stimulate them, will make
males thrust mating? - No, not based stimulation experiments. -
Mm. - based imaging experiments right now. - see, see. - see
look preoptic area neurons active different phases
aggression, see different neurons active sniffing,
mounting, thrusting ejaculation, become repeatedly activated time
animal goes cycle. - mating, yeah. - mating cycle.
also neurons active aggression, distinct,
don't know whether neurons promote aggression inhibit
mating animals fighting. evidence suggest may
latter, don't know sure yet. thermosensitive neurons really interesting,
mentioned phrase, "In heat," context aggression,
talk hotblooded people hotheads, just recently paper showing
thermoregulatory neurons VMH well. homeostatic systems
metabolic control temperature control intermingled nuclei, zones
control basic survival behaviors, like mating aggression predator
defense. imagine thermal regulation tightly connected energy
expenditure, that, again, neurons mixed together facilitate integration
signals brain way don't understand maintain
proper balance energy conservation energy consumption


particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes

neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together

particular behavior behavior. mean, always fascinated question,
violence goes summertime temperatures high?
really something idea increased temperature increases
violence? seems hard believe homeothermic pretty much
stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit. social reasons happens, people
outside, street, bumping other, think well
something ties thermoregulation aggressiveness, well mating behavior. -
Fascinating, yeah. ask hopes maybe years come lab will parse
temperature relationships. realize also regulated
hormones general, tapping two systems completely different reasons,
anyway, area intrigues me, notion hotheadedness. - Right.
- cool, calm collected. also fact that, probably should've asked
earlier, arousal tethered whole mating reproductive
process. mean, without sort seesawing back sympathetic
parasympathetic arousal, relaxed states, no mating will take place.

01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior Dominance?

fascinating way different competing forces seesaws operate.
Several times discussion far, hit idea behavior
can reflect different states, different states can converge multiple behaviors
well. paper not long ago mounting behavior, found fascinating.
Maybe tell us result, because, me, really speaks fact
mounting behavior can, one context, sexual, another context, actually
related to, presume, dominance. think friends practice jujitsu,
talk result, say, "Of course, mounting person
dominating them, nothing sexual it," overtaking physically,
literally neck side, opposed lying back. - [David] Hmm. -
Just fascinating, primitive. - Hmm. - yet, think speaks idea
mounting behavior might one fundamental ways animals
perhaps even humans express dominance and/or sexual interactions. - Yep,
fascinating question, harder figure might've thought.
debate long time field, see two male mice
mounting other, homosexual behavior, case mistaken sexual


identification, dominance behavior? train AI algorithm try
distinguish male-male mounting male-female mounting, not good
job, motorically, behaviors look similar. wind
figuring male-male mounting dominance mounting? two
important clues, one context, male-male mounting tends
prominent among mice haven't lot fighting experience.
become experienced fighting, will show relatively less mounting
towards male attack, transition quickly mounting
attack, mounting always seen context overall aggressive
interaction. second thing, which, believe not, suggested
computational, theoretical person lab, Ann Kennedy, now lab
Northwestern. said, "Well, males known sing mount females,
ultrasonic vocalizations, don't see kinds songs singing
mounting males? Maybe different kind song." Well, found is,
don't sing mounting male, can easily distinguish
whether mounting behavior male mouse reproductive agonistic, aggressive,
according whether accompanied ultrasonic vocalizations not. turns
different brain regions maximally active different types mounting.
VMH, aggression locus actually active dominance mounting,
can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, weakly activate VMH, whereas
MPOA strongly activated sexual mounting, always
accompanied ultrasonic vocalization. shows difficult dangerous
can try infer animal's state, intent, emotion, behavior
exhibiting behavior can mean different things depending
context interaction animal. - say, even
animal human multiple humans. - right, many
examples, animals show chasing obtain food, prey animal going kill
eat, show chasing obtain mate going sex with.
intent chasing completely different, don't know cases
whether separate circuits common circuits activated. -
obsessed dogs dog breeds et cetera, et cetera, one thing can tell
female dogs will mount thrust. female pit bull mix, sweet
dog, observing her, convinced one can never assume male dogs
aggressive female dogs. turns out, talking people quite


skilled dog genetics dog breeding, dominance hierarchy within
litter crosses male-female delineations. can get female litter
dominant male subordinate, no one really knows
relates to. also little dogs sometimes will get right face big
Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. - just start barking, idiotic thing do,
can dominant much larger dog.

01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior

- Hmm. - strange, anyway. Female-female mounting, observe
mice? known circuits, evokes female-female mounting, female-to-
male mounting occurs? - Good, yes, clear examples females displaying
male-type mounting behavior towards females. see commonly
lab housing females sisters, say three four cage, take
one mate male, male's mounting, now
take female put back cage litter mates starts
mounting them. Now, function is, function, means,
driving it, don't know, know stimulate neurons
control mounting males medial preoptic area, stimulate
population females, evokes male-type mounting towards either male female
target. fact, movie female just mounted
male, male's top underneath, stimulate region
MPOA female. crawls underneath male just
mounted her, circles around behind climbs top starts try
mount thrust him. - name online, called switch. [Andrew
laughing] - right? [laughing] - [Andrew] Don't ask know that. - Okay. -
pretty, yeah, term hear. also hear term topping
bottom, sounds like literal topping bottom. - see. -
psychological phrase, hear. friends educating
language, mostly find kind neurobiological discussion fascinating.
point, right? attempt, mind, superimpose observations
online communities. - Yeah. - told asked this,
point out, always dangerous, fact, inappropriate make one-to-one link. -
Yes. - Humans, maintain neural circuitry pathways


talking today mice, forebrain allow context, et cetera. - Yep. -
Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,
structure always fascinated can't figure hell for,
'cause seems involved everything, PAG, periaqueductal gray,
little bit back brain, people don't know. studied
context pain, studied context so-called lordosis response,
receptivity arching back female receive intromission mating
male. think PAG? Clearly, can't involved
everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate
student, think geneticist heart, just way like think things.

PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet
standing open toilet bowl. - Mm-hmm. - imagine clock face
projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines
type behavior will emitted neurons region stimulated.
think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide
released adrenal medulla, controls fight-or-flight responses,
peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know
activates receptor discovered many years ago
involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating
behavior, don't know, certainly possible. don't know whether
analgesic mechanisms happening PAG, also happening little
spinal cord. PAG really continuous spinal cord,
just follow towards tail animal, will wind spinal cord.
influences acting many levels pain PAG
spinal cord well. may well known, just don't know it, want


distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,
ignorant them, just don't broad enough knowledge base know
that. - Sure, appreciate delineations. Thank you, PAG, think description
old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate
student, think geneticist heart, just way like think things.
started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault
spinal cord. - Yeah. - body back forth, okay. think


body, terms states? point, love comment heat
map experiment, seem regularity people
experience emotions. people rage, instance, seem feel
gut head, seems, average. people love extrapolate gut
intuition chakras anger stomach, goes Eastern
medicine, et cetera. think mind-body context states,
think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.
think exciting now people going developing tools will
allow us turn turn off specific subsets fibers within vagus nerve ask
affects particular emotional behaviors. absolutely right, brain-
body connection critical, not just gut, heart, lungs, kinds
parts body, Darwin recognized well. think central
feature emotion state, think, underlies subjective feelings
emotion. - Incredible, well, David, say, true fan work lab
many decades, first all, delighted
stopped working stem cells. [David laughing] Not weren't
incredible work there, saw talk showed movie octopus
spitting out, not spitting, squirting bunch ink escaping, said
going work things sort talking today, fear,
aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. incredible see work
lab done, know speak behalf tremendous number people
say thank taking time important schedule share us
learned. last question simple one, is, will come back
talk us future additional work sure come? -
happy that, really appreciated questions, right
money, hit critical, important issues field.
uncovered known, little bit known, much not known, think
important emphasize unknown things, next generation
neuroscientists solve. hope will help attract young people
field, important, particularly understanding mental illness
mental health psychiatry, got figure emotion systems
controlled causal way ever want improve psychiatric treatments
now, going require next generation people coming


field. - Absolutely, second that.

Yeah. - function female mounting, don't know, type
dominance display. hard measure people haven't worked female-
dominance hierarchies extent worked male-dominance
hierarchies, indicates circuits male-type mounting females,
early work Catherine Dulac suggested years ago. - Fascinating,
fascinating. love paper because, pointed chase, mounting
behavior, see think one thing specifically, hearing result,
actually, not big fan fight sports. watch occasionally 'cause friends
them, seen boxing matches, MMA matches, end round,
someone felt dominated, will unsportsmanlike thing thrusting
back person get off. - Really? - Almost like, "I dominated
you, I'm," mimicking sexual-like behavior,

no reason think sexual, sending message. - Yeah. -
dominance implies. love talk something slightly off
circuitry, think related circuitry, least way,

everything, guessing least complex regions
talking about, different types neurons controlling different things,
PAG play this? particular, want know, mechanism pain
modulation control fighting and/or mating? reason ask that,
not combat sports person, years ago, little bit martial arts, always
impressive little hurt get punched fight much hurt
afterwards, [laughing] right? clearly endogenous pain control. - Yep. -
wears off, feel beat up. - [David] Yep. - least, case,
felt beat up. PAG vis-a-vis pain, pain vis-a-vis


behaviors? - Good, good. think PAG like old-fashioned telephone switchboard,
calls coming in, cables punched right
hole get information, routed right recipient end it,
pretty much every type innate behavior can think PAG
implicated. whole literature showing involvement PAG fear,
different regions PAG, dorsal PAG involved panic-like behavior, running
away, ventral PAG involved freezing behavior. MPOA VMH send
projections PAG, different regions PAG. cross-section, hate say
this, cross-section, PAG kind looks like water toilet

projected onto that, like PAG sectors, one 12, maybe even
them, sectors, find different neurons hypothalamus
projecting. turn topographic arrangement along
dorsal-ventral axis PAG medial-lateral axis PAG determines

think sort evidence pointing direction, no means,
mapped out. Now, thing mentioned not hurting got beat
martial arts, well-known phenomenon called fear-induced analgesia,
animal high state fear, like trying defend itself,
suppression pain responses, not sure completely mechanisms
well understood, example, adrenal gland peptide

peptide analgesic activities. Now, whether. - May ask peptide is? -
called bovine adrenal medullary peptide 22 amino acid residues. know

involved pain, thought promoted pain, turns actually
inhibits pain, like endogenous analgesic. Whether happening, type
analgesia happening animal engaged offensive aggression mating

distinguish clearly things not known, know unknown,
fairly small area expertise, things may known,

old-fashioned telephone switchboard, now every time look toilet,
think periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] right. - [Andrew] every time
see image periaqueductal gray, think toilet. - right. [laughing] -
excellent description, because, fact, drew circle little thing
bottom. well, put post link picture PAG understand
David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate
student, think geneticist heart, just way like think things.
started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological

answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall
gallbladder. - Yes. - Somebody lot gall. - right. - don't know
make fist say that. - Right. - guessing gall bladder shaped
like fist. [Andrew laughing] - right, physiology underlying
heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,
mediated peripheral nervous system, sympathetic
parasympathetic nervous system, control heart rate, example, blood vessel,
blood pressure. neurons receive input hypothalamus brain
regions, central brain regions control activity. brain put
particular state, activates sympathetic parasympathetic neurons,
effects heart blood pressure, these, turn, feed back onto brain
sensory system. large part bidirectional communication also
mediated vagus nerve, many listeners viewers may
heard become topic intense activity now. People known
long time, vagus nerve bundle nerve fibers comes basically
skull, central nervous system, sends fibers heart,
gut, sorts visceral organs. information both, used words earlier
discussion, afferent efferent. vagal fibers sense things
happening body, reason feel stomach tied knots
tense vagal fibers sensing contraction gut muscles,


also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
states fascinating question people just beginning scrape surface of.

David chuckling here,

01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression

because, indeed, looks like toilet, staring toilet. Tell us tachykinin,
talked couple times different podcast episodes
relationship social isolation, part, podcast launched
time social isolation. understanding tachykinin,
tell us moment, present flies mice humans, may
similar things species. - right, tachykinin refers family related
neuropeptides. brain chemicals, different dopamine
serotonin not small, organic molecules, actually short pieces
protein directly encoded genes active specific neurons not
others. neurons active, neuropeptides released together
classical transmitters, like glutamate, whatever. Tachykinins famously
implicated pain, particularly Tachykinin-I, called Substance P, one
original pain modulating, something promotes inflammatory pain.
tachykinin genes, mice, two, humans, think three,
Drosophila, one. way got tachykinins studying
aggression flies. thought, since neuropeptides remarkable parallel
evolutionary conservation structure function, like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding
worms, flies mice people. Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
worms mice people. thought might find peptides control
aggression flies people, screen, unbiased screen peptides,
found, indeed, one tachykinins, Drosophila tachykinin, neurons


activate strongly promote aggression, depends release
tachykinin. Now, interesting thing that, flies, just like people practically
social animal shows aggression, social isolation increases
aggressiveness. putting violent prisoner solitary confinement absolutely
worst, counterproductive thing them. indeed, found flies
social isolation increases level tachykinin brain, shut gene
down, prevents isolation increasing aggression. since lab also works
mice, natural see whether tachykinins might upregulated social
isolation whether play role aggression. work done former
postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, now University Salt Lake City Utah, found,
remarkably, mice socially isolated two weeks, massive
upregulation Tachykinin-II brain. fact, tag peptide green
fluorescent protein jellyfish, genetically, brain looks green mice
socially isolated 'cause much stuff released. went show
increase tachykinin responsible effect social isolation increase
aggressiveness increase fear increase anxiety. fact, drugs
block receptor tachykinin tested humans abandoned
no efficacy tests analyzed for. give
drugs socially isolated mouse, blocks effects social isolation. blocks
aggression, blocks increased fear increased anxiety, Moriel
described it, "The mice just look chill." not sedative, really important,
not mice going sleep. remarkably is, socially isolate
mouse becomes aggressive, can never put back cage brothers
litter will kill overnight, give drug,
called osanetant, blocks Tachykinin-II, mouse can returned cage
brothers will not attack them, seems happy rest
time. incredibly powerful effect drug, really interested
trying get pharmaceutical companies test drug, really good
safety profile humans, testing people subjected social isolation
stress bereavement stress. one areas learned eye-
opening lesson, basic scientist naively thought make discovery
translational applications humans, pharmaceutical companies
going falling try it. not interested,
burned, twice shy, drugs tested efficacy schizophrenia. no


idea why, little preclinical data suggest that. Not surprisingly, failed.
drug fails clinical trials Phase 3, costs $100 million company
carried clinical trial. huge slag heap discarded pharmaceuticals,
many inhibitors neuropeptide action, useful indications,
one discovered, huge economic disincentive
pharmaceutical companies test again, conclusion drew
failed tests, particularly 2010s that, reason
failed animal experiments drugs don't predict humans will
respond drugs, therefore, shouldn't try extrapolate data
get animal experiments, mouse rat experiments humans,
lead us wrong track, think probably wrong.
cases, may right, cases, good reason think,
brain regions molecules evolutionarily conserved
playing similar role humans. fact, paper showing humans
borderline personality disorder, strong correlation self-
reported level aggressiveness serum levels tachykinin, case,
Tachykinin-I, detected radioimmunoassay. work Emil Coccaro,
clinical psychiatrist University Chicago. smoking gun case
humans well. actually trying interest pharmaceutical company
testing drugs, actually, treatment hot flashes females, humans,
actually good animal data think might useful, realized
clinical trial going COVID pandemic. approached said,
"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic
pets, multi-billion-dollar industry country. ways
can made feel better separated owners,
certainly good thing. - Absolutely, will put call, putting call,
know sure will response. Just underscoring talking
even more, every time hear school shooting, like Texas recently,
happened New York time subway shooting.
whatever reason, listened book Columbine, went detailed
way origin boys committed that, every single time, person
commits acts socially isolated, far know. - Yeah, yeah. - might
exceptions there. sometimes crosses mental health
issues, sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. social isolation clearly
drives powerful neurochemical neuro biological changes, really hope
Tachykinin-I II, main ones humans? - Yeah, yeah. - Will explored
detail. Also, didn't know Tachykinin-I Substance P. - Yes. -
Substance P Tachykinin-I. - Yes. Tachykinin-I gene name, Tachykinin-II,


humans, called Neurokinin B, name protein. just refer
gene name 'cause makes easier don't keep remembering two names
thing. - not mistaken, put company geneticists
original training genetics, immunology areas related that. -
cell biology, didn't actually formal training genetics graduate
student, think geneticist heart, just way like think things.
started working flies, sort of,

01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve

came closet geneticist, were. [laughing] - Wonderful, long
talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological
measurement, not. yet, don't think can discussion
emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,
beautiful place. yet, mind-body, me, neurobiological construct. -
Yes. - nervous system extends cranial vault

think scientists, maybe even neuroscientists geneticists? - Good,
answer first question heat maps people associating certain
parts body certain emotional feelings, goes back something called
somatic marker hypothesis, proposed Antonio Damasio, neurologist
USC, idea subjective feeling particular emotion is, part, associated
sensation something happening particular part body, gut,
heart, don't see liver invoked much emotional characterization, but. - gall

"Look, nature may actually done experiment want do,
'cause people getting drug placebo going
socially isolated will not. don't get fill
questionnaires see whether ones given drug socially isolated
felt less stressed less anxious ones not socially isolated?"
not touch it, middle clinical trial different
indication drug, report observation make
drug patient population. ask questions get
unfavorable answer, "Oh God, felt even worse took drug
isolated," obliged report FDA torpedo
chances drug approved thing clinical trials for.
better not ask not know try find information


lead another clinical indication. remain convinced family drugs
powerful uses treating forms stress-induced anxiety
aggressiveness humans, just difficult, economic reasons, find way
get somebody test that. - Yeah, true shame companies won't this,
especially given fact many drugs exist safety profiles
established, 'cause always serious consideration. - Yep. - embarking
clinical trial. Perhaps hearing discussion, someone will understand
key importance will reach us, provide ways that, get
study going humans. think enough laboratories ran small-scale clinical
trials, pharma certainly perk ears, right? mean, strategic. -
Yep. - Sometimes own. - mean, like say also, like see
tested pets. mean, huge number pets right now suffering
separation anxiety humans bought keep company
COVID pandemic, now home alone. - now home alone, yeah. -
Okay? thing works mice, certainly higher chance going work
dogs cats going work humans. did, even
encouragement continue along lines. People sometimes forget
although work animals ultimately want understand humans, care
results apply welfare animals well, particularly domestic

talking humans, love get thoughts human studies
emotion. know wrote book Ralph Adolphs, new book,
provide link to, read front back twice, phenomenal. - Thank you. -
mentioned podcast, really, books worth
reading, books important, think book truly
important general population read understand, neuroscientists
read understand contents, we, culture, way off terms
think emotions states behaviors. put link that, really
worth time energy read it, written beautifully, say. - Thank
you. - accessible even non-scientists. heat map diagram book
think about, heat map diagram subjective reports people gave
experience emotion, feeling, somatic feeling, body,
head, both, angry, sad, calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
wouldn't want people think heat maps generated physiological

emotions states sorts behaviors talking today
without thinking body also. - [David] Yep. - not coming
Northern California, mind-body. - Yeah. - Esalen once. [David laughing]
didn't go baths, went there, gave talk left. beautiful. anyone
wants know looks like, think final scene "Mad Men" shot Esalen,

answer first question heat maps people associating certain

heat maps, reflect increased blood flow different structures. that,
turn, reflects talking about, is, emotion definitely involves
communication brain body, bidirectional communication,

also afferents, means information coming brain can
influence peripheral organs well. work number labs, just
last six months so, people starting decode components
different fibers vagus nerve. amazing much specificity is,
specific vagal nerves go lung, control breathing responses, go
gut, go organs. almost like set color-coded lines, labeled lines
things. now vagal afferents play role playing emotion
